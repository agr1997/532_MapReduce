(261%&%Enter the King and Queen, preceded by Polonius, Hamlet, Laertes23, Lords, Ladies, and Attendants.)
(311%&%Pol. (R.) He hath, my lord, (wrung from me my slow leave)
(331%&%Ham. Not so, my lord; I am too much i'the sun.32)
(483%&%Ham. Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:52)
(540%&%Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all,)
(696%&%Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,)
(922%&%Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think.)
(982%&%Ham. (L.C.) The king doth wake to-night,87 and takes his rouse,88)
(1080%&%Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,96)
(1121%&%[Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet, L.H., followed at a distance by Horatio and Marcellus.])
(1363%&%Ham. How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?)
(1378%&%Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave)
(1440%&%[Horatio and Marcellus place each their right hand on Hamlet's sword.])
(1468%&%As, Well, we know; or, We could, an if we would; or, If)
(1509%&%I.1 me:] i.e., me who am already on the watch, and have a right to demand the watch-word.)
(1521%&%I.7 To watch the minutes of this night;] This seems to have been an expression common in Shakespeare's time.)
(1523%&%I.8 Approve our eyes,] To approve, in Shakespeare's age, signified to make good or establish.)
(1525%&%I.9 What we have seen.] We must here supply "with," or "by relating" before "what we have seen.")
(1527%&%I.10 It harrows me with fear and wonder.] i.e., it confounds and overwhelms me.)
(1529%&%I.11 Usurp'st this time of night,] i.e., abuses, uses against right, and the order of things.)
(1541%&%I.17 Palmy state] Outspread, flourishing. Palm branches were the emblem of victory.)
(1563%&%I.22 The extravagant and erring spirit] Extravagant is, got out of his bounds. Erring is here used in the sense of wandering.)
(1565%&%I.23 Laertes is unknown in the original story, being an introduction of Shakespeare's.)
(1585%&%Catch the auspicious moment! be time thine own! and may the exercise of thy fairest virtue fill up those hours, that are wholly at your command!)
(1587%&%I.31 A little more than kin, and less than kind.] Dr. Johnson says that kind is the Teutonic word for child. Hamlet, therefore, answers to the titles of cousin and son, which the king had given him, that he was somewhat more than cousin, and less than son. Steevens remarks, that it seems to have been another proverbial phrase: "The nearer we are in blood, the further we must be from love; the greater the kindred is, the less the kindness must be." Kin is still used in the Midland Counties for cousin, and kind signifies nature. Hamlet may, therefore, mean that the relationship between them had become unnatural.)
(1589%&%I.32 I am too much i'the sun.] Meaning, probably, his being sent for from his studies to be exposed at his uncle's marriage as his chiefest courtier, and being thereby placed too much in the radiance of the king's presence; or, perhaps, an allusion to the proverb, "Out of Heaven's blessing, into the warm sun:" but it is not unlikely that a quibble is meant between son and sun.)
(1611%&%I.43 Sits smiling to my heart:] To is at: gladdens my heart.)
(1613%&%I.44 In grace whereof,] i.e., respectful regard or honour of which.)
(1615%&%I.45 No jocund health, that Denmark drinks to-day,] Dr. Johnson remarks, that the king's intemperance is very strongly impressed; everything that happens to him gives him occasion to drink. The Danes were supposed to be hard drinkers.)
(1617%&%I.46 Resolve itself] To resolve is an old word signifying to dissolve.)
(1633%&%I.54 But what make you] What is your object? What are you doing?)
(1635%&%I.55 What, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?] In Shakespeare's time there was a university at Wittenberg; but as it was not founded till 1502, it consequently did not exist in the time to which this play refers.)
(1637%&%I.56 My dearest foe] i.e., my direst or most important foe. This epithet was commonly used to denote the strongest and liveliest interest in any thing or person, for or against.)
(1651%&%I.60 With the act of fear,] i.e., by the influence or power of fear.)
(1657%&%I.63 He wore his beaver up.] That part of the helmet which may be lifted up, to take breath the more freely.)
(1671%&%I.70 Puff'd and reckless libertine.] Bloated and swollen, the effect of excess; and heedless and indifferent to consequences.)
(1673%&%I.71 Recks not his own read.] i.e., heeds not his own lessons or counsel.)
(1677%&%I.73 Look thou charácter.] i.e., a word often used by Shakespeare to signify to write, strongly infix; the accent is on the second syllable.)
(1691%&%I.80 Given private time to you;] Spent his time in private visits to you.)
(1693%&%I.81 As so 'tis put on me,] Suggested to, impressed on me.)
(1703%&%i.e., inexperienced girl. Unsifted means one who has not nicely canvassed and examined the peril of her situation.)
(1707%&%I.85 Slander any leisure moment,] i.e., I would not have you so disgrace your most idle moments, as not to find better employment for them than lord Hamlet's conversation.)
(1709%&%I.86 An eager air.] Eager here means sharp, from aigre, French.)
(1727%&%I.95 At a pin's fee;] i.e., the value of a pin.)
(1729%&%I.96 What if it tempt you toward the flood, &c.] Malignant spirits were supposed to entice their victims into places of gloom and peril, and exciting in them the deepest terror.)
(1741%&%I.102 Hair to stand on end,] A common image of that day. "Standing as frighted with erected haire.")
(1743%&%I.103 The fretful porcupine:] This animal being considered irascible and timid.)
(1747%&%I.105 Rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,] i.e., in indolence and sluggishness, by its torpid habits contributes to that morbid state of its juices which may figuratively be denominated rottenness.)
(1761%&%I.112 Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd;] To housel is to minister the sacrament to one lying on his death bed. Disappointed is the same as unappointed, which here means unprepared. Unanel'd is without extreme unction.)
(1765%&%I.114 Pale his uneffectual fire:] i.e., not seen by the light of day; or it may mean, shining without heat.)
(1767%&%I.115 In this distracted globe.] i.e., his head distracted with thought.)
(1781%&%I.122 Give it welcome.] Receive it courteously, as you would a stranger when introduced.)
(1783%&%I.123 Antick disposition] i.e., strange, foreign to my nature, a disposition which Hamlet assumes as a protection against the danger which he apprehends from his uncle, and as a cloak for the concealment of his own meditated designs.)
(1787%&%I.125 Friending to you—shall not lack] Disposition to serve you shall not be wanting.)
(1952%&%King. (C.) O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.)
(2003%&%[Reads] To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified Ophelia,—12)
(2005%&%That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase, beautified is a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:)
(2023%&%O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;15 I have not art to reckon my groans: but that I love thee best, O most best,16 believe it. Adieu.)
(2025%&%Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,17 Hamlet.)
(2090%&%Pol. Hath there been such a time (I'd fain know that,))
(2119%&%Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:)
(2160%&%Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god, kissing carrion,——Have you a daughter?27)
(2164%&%Ham. Let her not walk i'the sun: conception is a blessing; but as your daughter may conceive,—friend, look to't, look to't, look to't.)
(2168%&%Pol. (Aside.) Still harping on my daughter:—yet he knew me not at first; he said I was a fishmonger. [Crosses to L.] I'll speak to him again.—What do you read, my lord?)
(2182%&%Pol. (Aside.) Though this be madness, yet there's method in it. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?)
(2210%&%Ham. (C.) Then is dooms-day near: but your news is not true. In the beaten way of friendship,30 what make you at Elsinore?)
(2214%&%Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you. Were you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come, come, deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.)
(2218%&%Ham. Any thing—but to the purpose. You were sent for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties have not craft enough to colour: I know the good king and queen have sent for you.)
(2241%&%Ham. Why did you laugh, then, when I said, Man delights not me?)
(2243%&%Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten entertainment38 the players shall receive from you: we coted them on the way;39 and hither are they coming, to offer you service.)
(2245%&%Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome, his majesty shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall end his part in peace;40 and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't.41—What players are they?)
(2247%&%Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the tragedians of the city.)
(2249%&%Ham. How chances it, they travel?42 their residence, both in reputation and profit, was better both ways. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city? Are they so followed?)
(2263%&%Ham. I am but mad north-north west: when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a hern-shaw.46)
(2269%&%Ham. (Crosses C.) Hark you, Guildenstern;—and Rosencrantz: that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling-clouts.)
(2289%&%Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastorical-comical, historical-pastoral, scene indivisible, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light.49 For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men.50)
(2313%&%Ham. Why, As by lot, God wot,51 and then, you know, It came to pass, As most like it was,—The first row of the pious Chanson52 will show you more; for look, my abridgment comes.53)
(2315%&%Enter Four or Five Players (L.H.)—Polonius crosses behind Hamlet to R.H.)
(2317%&%You are welcome, masters; welcome, all: O, old friend! 44Why, thy face is valanced54 since I saw thee last; Com'st thou to beard me55 in Denmark?—What, my young lady and mistress. By-'r-lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine.56 You are welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers,57 fly at anything we see: We'll have a speech straight: Come, give us a taste of your quality;58 come, a passionate speech.)
(2395%&%Pol. Look, whether he has not turned his colour, and has tears in's eyes.—Prithee, no more.)
(2397%&%Ham. (C.) 'Tis well; I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.—Good, my lord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time: After your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.)
(2399%&%Pol. (R.) My lord, I will use them according to their desert.)
(2401%&%Ham. Much better: Use every man after his desert, and who shall 'scape whipping? Use them after your own honour and dignity: The less they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty. Take them in.)
(2421%&%Ham. Very well.—Follow that lord; and look you mock him not.)
(2478%&%Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i'the throat,)
(2553%&%II.1 Polonius,] Doctor Johnson describes Polonius as "a man bred in courts, exercised in business, stored with observation, confident in his knowledge, proud of his eloquence, and declining into dotage. A man positive and confident, because he knows his mind was once strong, and knows not that it is become weak." The idea of dotage encroaching upon wisdom will solve all the phenomena of the character of Polonius.)
(2557%&%II.3 Ecstacy of love;] i.e., madness of love. In this sense the word is now obsolete.)
(2575%&%II.8 In the full bent,] To the full stretch and range—a term derived from archery.)
(2577%&%II.9 The trail of policy] The trail is the course of an animal pursued by the scent.)
(2579%&%II.10 Expostulate] To expostulate is to discuss, to put the pros and cons, to answer demands upon the question. Expose is an old term of similar import.)
(2593%&%II.17 Whilst this machine is to him,] Belongs to, obey his impulse; so long as he is "a sensible warm motion," the similar expression to "While my wits are my own.")
(2599%&%II.20 If I had played the desk, or table book;] This line may either mean if I had conveyed intelligence between them, or, known of their love, if I had locked up his secret in my own breast, as closely as it were confined in a desk or table book.)
(2601%&%II.21 Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb;] i.e., connived at it.)
(2607%&%II.24 Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;] She took the fruits of advice when she obeyed advice, the advice was then made fruitful.—Johnson.)
(2621%&%II.31 Rights of our fellowship and constancy of our youth,] Habits of familiar intercourse and correspondent years.)
(2623%&%II.32 A better proposer] An advocate of more address in shaping his aims, who could make a stronger appeal.)
(2627%&%II.34 Nay, then, I have an eye of you.] i.e., I have a glimpse of your meaning. Hamlet's penetration having shown him that his two friends are set over him as spies.)
(2629%&%II.35 So shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather.] Be beforehand with your discovery, and the plume and gloss of your secret pledge be in no feather shed or tarnished.)
(2641%&%II.41 The lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't.] i.e., the lady shall mar the measure of the verse, rather than not express herself freely and fully.)
(2645%&%II.43 It is not very strange; for my uncle is king of Denmark;] This is a reflection on the mutability of fortune, and the variableness of man's mind.)
(2647%&%II.44 Make mouths at him] i.e., deride him by antic gestures and mockery.)
(2661%&%II.51 As by lot, God wot,] There was an old ballad entitled the song of Jephthah, from which these lines are probably quotations. The story of Jephthah was also one of the favourite subjects of ancient tapestry.)
(2663%&%II.52 The first row of the pious Chanson] This expression does not appear to be very well understood. Steevens tells us that the pious chansons were a kind of Christmas carols, containing some scriptural history thrown into loose rhymes, and sung about the streets. The first row appears to mean the first division of one of these.)
(2665%&%II.53 My abridgment comes.] Hamlet alludes to the players, whose approach will shorten his talk.)
(2667%&%II.54 Thy face is valanced] i.e., fringed with a beard. The valance is the fringes or drapery hanging round the tester of a bed.)
(2669%&%II.55 Com'st thou to beard me] To beard anciently meant to set at defiance. Hamlet having just told the player that his face is valanced, is playing upon the word beard.)
(2681%&%II.61 Falls with the whiff and wind of his fell sword] Our author employs the same image in almost the same phrase:)
(2711%&%II.73 I'll tent him to the quick:] i.e., probe him—search his wounds.)
(2733%&%Guild. (R.) Nor do we find him forward1 to be sounded)
(2764%&%King. With all my heart; and it doth much content me)
(2957%&%Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.25)
(2959%&%Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?)
(2973%&%Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.)
(2977%&%Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry. Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a nunnery; farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; go; go.)
(3004%&%To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!)
(3071%&%Ham. O, reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them:54 for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators55 to laugh too; though, in the mean time, some necessary question56 of the play be then to be considered: that's villainous, and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.)
(3093%&%To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?)
(3154%&%March. Enter King and Queen, preceded by Polonius, Ophelia, Horatio, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, Lords, Ladies, and Attendants. King and Queen sit (L.H.); Ophelia (R.H.))
(3158%&%Ham. (C.) Excellent, i'faith; of the cameleon's dish: I eat the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.)
(3170%&%Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there.—Be the players ready?)
(3190%&%Ham. O, your only jig-maker.71 What should a man do but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.)
(3194%&%Ham. So long? Nay, then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a suit of sables.72 O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half a year: But, by'r-lady, he must build churches, then.73)
(3224%&%P. King. (R.) Full thirty times hath Phœbus' cart76 gone round)
(3244%&%P. King. 'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;)
(3275%&%62P. Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!)
(3310%&%King. Have you heard the argument?80 Is there no offence in't?)
(3312%&%Ham. No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i'the world.)
(3316%&%Ham. The mouse-trap.81 Marry, how? Tropically.82 This play is the image of a murder83 done in Vienna: Gonzago is the Duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you shall see anon;—'tis a knavish piece of work: but what of that? your majesty, and we that have free souls, it touches us not: Let the galled jade wince,84 our withers85 are unwrung.)
(3363%&%O, good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand pounds. Didst perceive?)
(3411%&%Ham. O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration?—impart.)
(3413%&%Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you go to bed.)
(3415%&%Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any further trade with us?94)
(3435%&%[Exeunt Horatio and Musicians R.H. Guildenstern, after speaking privately to Rosencrantz, crosses behind Hamlet to R.H.])
(3437%&%66Why do you go about to recover the wind of me,100 as if you would drive me into a toil?101)
(3439%&%Guil. (R.) O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.102)
(3453%&%Ham. 'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with your fingers and thumb, give it breath with your mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music.103 Look you, these are the stops.)
(3455%&%Guil. But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony; I have not the skill.)
(3457%&%Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass: and there is much music, excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot you make it speak. 'Sdeath, do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me, you cannot play upon me.104)
(3477%&%Ham. Then will I come to my mother by and by. They fool me to the top of my bent.105 I will come by and by.)
(3512%&%King. I like him not; nor stands it safe with us107)
(3565%&%Pol. He will come straight. Look, you lay home to him:112)
(3567%&%Tell him his pranks have been too broad113 to bear with,)
(3611%&%Ham. Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;)
(3675%&%Queen. (Sits R.C.) What have I done, that thou dar'st wag thy tongue)
(3790%&%Save me [Starts from his chair], and hover o'er me with your wings,)
(3798%&%Ham. (L.) Do you not come your tardy son to chide,)
(3947%&%III.5 May here affront Ophelia:] To affront is to come face to face—to confront.)
(3970%&%III.15 His quietus make] Quietus means the official discharge of an account: from the Latin. Particularly in the Exchequer accounts, where it is still current. Chiefly used by authors in metaphorical senses.)
(3972%&%III.16 A bare bodkin?] Bodkin was an ancient term for a small dagger. In the margin of Stowe's Chronicle it is said that Cæsar was slain with bodkins.)
(3974%&%III.17 Who would fardels bear,] Fardel is a burden. Fardellus, low Latin.)
(3978%&%III.19 No traveller returns,] The traveller whom Hamlet had seen, though he appeared in the same habit which he had worn in his life-time, was nothing but a shadow, "invulnerable as the air," and, consequently, incorporeal. The Ghost has given us no account of the region from whence he came, being, as he himself informed us, "forbid to tell the secrets of his prison-house."—Malone.)
(3989%&%From this sole consideration have their drifts diverted, and lose the character and name of enterprise.)
(4001%&%III.27 Inoculate our old stock, but we shall relish of it:] So change the original constitution and properties, as that no smack of them shall remain. "Inoculate our stock" are terms in gardening.)
(4003%&%III.28 With more offences at my beck] That is, always ready to come about me—at my beck and call.)
(4005%&%III.29 Than I have thoughts to put them in, &c.] "To put a thing into thought," Johnson says, is "to think on it.")
(4007%&%III.30 I have heard of your paintings,] These destructive aids of beauty seem, in the time of Shakespeare, to have been general objects of satire.)
(4009%&%III.31 Heaven hath given you one face, and you make yourselves another:] i.e., Heaven hath given you one face, and you disfigure his image by making yourself another.)
(4023%&%III.38 The mould of form,] The cast, in which is shaped the only perfect form.)
(4041%&%III.47 It out-herods Herod:] In all the old moralities and mysteries this personage was always represented as a tyrant of a very violent temper, using the most exaggerated language. Hence the expression.)
(4043%&%III.48 The very age and body of the time its form and pressure.] i.e., to delineate exactly the manners of the age, and the particular humours of the day—pressure signifying resemblance, as in a print.)
(4045%&%III.49 Come tardy off,] Without spirit or animation; heavily, sleepily done.)
(4047%&%III.50 The censure of which one] i.e., the censure of one of which.)
(4063%&%III.58 Pregnant hinges of the knee,] i.e., bowed or bent: ready to kneel where thrift, that is, thriving, or emolument may follow sycophancy.)
(4065%&%III.59 Since my dear soul] Dear is out of which arises the liveliest interest.)
(4067%&%III.60 Whose blood and judgment] Dr. Johnson says that according to the doctrine of the four humours, desire and confidence were seated in the blood, and judgment in the phlegm, and the due mixture of the humours made a perfect character.)
(4069%&%III.61 The very comment of thy soul] The most intense direction of every faculty.)
(4081%&%III.67 You played once in the university, you say?] The practice of acting Latin plays in the universities of Oxford and Cambridge is very ancient, and continued to near the middle of the last century.)
(4083%&%III.68 I did enact Julius Cæsar:] A Latin play on the subject of Cæsar's death, was performed at Christ-church, Oxford, in 1582.)
(4085%&%III.69 They stay upon your patience.] Patience is here used for leisure.)
(4087%&%III.70 Lying down at Ophelia's feet.] To lie at the feet of a mistress during any dramatic representation, seems to have been a common act of gallantry.)
(4089%&%III.71 Jig-maker,] Writer of ludicrous interludes. A jig was not in Shakespeare's time only a dance, but a ludicrous dialogue in metre; many historical ballads were also called jigs.)
(4117%&%III.83 The image of a murder,] i.e., the lively portraiture, the correct and faithful representation of a murder, &c.)
(4135%&%i.e., begin without more delay; for the raven, foreknowing the deed, is already croaking, and, as it were, calling out for the revenge which will ensue.)
(4137%&%III.89 Midnight weeds] The force of the epithet midnight, will be best displayed by a corresponding passage in Macbeth:)
(4151%&%III.95 By these pickers and stealers.] i.e., by these hands. The phrase is taken from the Church catechism, where, in our duty to our neighbour, we are taught to keep our hands from picking and stealing.)
(4153%&%III.96 You do freely bar the door of your own liberty, if you deny your griefs to your friend.] By your own act you close the way against your own ease, and the free discharge of your griefs, if you open not the source of them to your friends.)
(4155%&%III.97 You have the voice of the king himself for your succession in Denmark?] Though the crown was elective, yet regard was paid to the recommendation of the preceding prince, and preference given to royal blood, which, by degrees, produced hereditary succession.)
(4157%&%III.98 "While the grass grows,"—the proverb is something musty.] The proverb is, "While the grass grows, the steed starves." Hamlet alludes to his own position, while waiting for his succession to the throne of Denmark. A similar adage is, "A slip between the cup and the lip.")
(4171%&%III.105 They fool me to the top of my bent.] To the height; as far as they see me incline to go: an allusion to the utmost flexure of a bow.)
(4175%&%III.107 Stands it safe with us] Is it consistent with our security.)
(4179%&%III.109 Behind the arras I'll convey myself,] The arras-hangings, in Shakespeare's time, were hung at such a distance from the walls, that a person might easily stand behind them unperceived.)
(4193%&%III.116 How now! a rat?] This is an expression borrowed from the History of Hamblet.)
(4199%&%III.119 Takes off the rose From the fair forehead of an innocent love, And sets a blister there;] i.e., takes the clear tint from the brow of unspotted, untainted innocence. "True or honest as the skin between one's brows" was a proverbial expression, and is frequently used by Shakespeare.)
(4201%&%III.120 As from the body of contraction plucks The very soul;] Annihilates the very principle of contracts. Contraction for marriage contract.)
(4205%&%III.122 Hypérion's curls;] Hyperion is used by Spenser with the same error in quantity.)

(4249%&%III.136 My stem effects:] i.e., change the nature of my purposes, or what I mean to effect.)
(4261%&%i.e., "Such shadows are the weak brain's forgeries." Ecstasy in this place, as in many others, means a temporary alienation of mind—a fit.)
(4380%&%Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain convocation of politick worms4 are e'en at him.)
(4384%&%Ham. In Heaven; send thither to see: if your messenger find him not there, seek him i'the other place yourself. But, indeed, if you find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby.)
(4513%&%Oph. Pray, you, let us have no words of this; but when they ask you what it means, say you this:)
(4540%&%Oph. (R.) I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him i'the cold ground. My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies; good night, good night.)
(4544%&%King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.)
(4683%&%Laer. (Coming down R) Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,)
(4687%&%Oph. You must sing, Down-a-down,22 an you call him a-down-a. O, how well the wheel becomes it!23 It is the false steward, that stole his master's daughter.)
(4793%&%Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come;)
(4962%&%IV.6 May'st not coldly set] Set is to value or estimate. "Thou may'st not set little by it, or estimate it lightly.")
(4966%&%IV.8 By letters conjuring to that effect,] The verb to conjure, in the sense of to supplicate, was formerly accented on the first syllable.)

(5002%&%IV.26 There's fennel for you, and columbines:] Fennel was considered an emblem of flattery, and columbine was anciently supposed to be a thankless flower; signifying probably that the courtiers flattered to get favours, and were thankless after receiving them. Columbine was emblematical of forsaken lovers.)
(5004%&%IV.27 There's rue for you; and here's some for me:—we may call it herb of grace o' Sundays:] Probably a quibble is meant here, as rue anciently signified the same as ruth, i.e., sorrow. In the common dictionaries of Shakespeare's time, it was called herb of grace. Ophelia wishes to remind the Queen of the sorrow and contrition she ought to feel for her unlawful marriage; and that she may wear her rue with peculiar propriety on Sundays, when she solicits pardon for the crime which she has so much occasion to rue and repent of.—Malone.)
(5006%&%IV.28 You may wear your rue with a difference.] i.e., to distinguish it from that worn by Ophelia, herself: because her tears flowed from the loss of a father—those of the Queen ought to flow for her guilt.)

(5064%&%IV.54 But that this folly drowns it.] i.e., my rage had flamed, if this flood of tears had not extinguished it.)
(5080%&%1st Clo. It must be se offendendo;4 it cannot be else. For here lies the point: If I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and an act hath three branches; it is, to act, to do, and to perform:5 argal,6 she drowned herself wittingly.)
(5084%&%1st Clo. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here stands the man; good: If the man go to this water, and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he goes,8 mark 88you that; but if the water come to him and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.)
(5116%&%1st Clo. Cudgel thy brains no more about it,15 for your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when you are asked this question next, say, a grave-maker, the houses that he makes, last till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan, and fetch me a stoup of liquor.16)
(5132%&%Ham. (Behind the grave.) Has this fellow no feeling of his business, he sings at grave-making?)

(5170%&%Ham. There's another: Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer? Where be his quiddits now, his quillets,21 his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce22 with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of his action of battery? I will speak to this fellow.—Whose grave's this, sirrah?)
(5198%&%1st Clo. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.)
(5200%&%Ham. How absolute the knave is!23 we must speak by the card,24 or equivocation will undo us, [To Horatio, R.] How long hast thou been a grave-maker?)
(5202%&%1st Clo. Of all the days i'the year, I came to't that day that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.)
(5206%&%1st Clo. Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: It was the very day that young Hamlet was born,25 he that is mad, and sent into England.)
(5226%&%1st Clo. Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty years.)
(5228%&%Ham. How long will a man lie i'the earth ere he rot?)
(5242%&%1st Clo. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! he poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.)
(5259%&%[Gives the skull to Horatio, who returns it to the grave-digger.])
(5291%&%Enter Priests, &c., in procession; the corpse of Ophelia, Laertes and Mourners following; King, Queen, their Trains, &c.)
(5385%&%Laer. (L., leaping from the grave.) The devil take thy soul!)
(5404%&%Ham. (R.C.) Why, I will fight with him upon this theme)
(5510%&%Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit.50 Your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.)
(5514%&%Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.)
(5518%&%Ham. But yet, methinks it is very sultry and hot,51 for my complexion,—)
(5534%&%Osr. Sir, you are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is—)
(5536%&%Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to know himself.58)
(5552%&%99Ham. The phrase would be more german62 to the matter, if we could carry cannon by our sides.)
(5554%&%Osr. The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; and it would come to immediate trial, if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.63)
(5558%&%Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.)
(5572%&%Ham. (C.) I do not think so; since he went into France, I have been in continual practice; I shall win at the odds.65 But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here about my heart: but it is no matter.)
(5576%&%Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving,66 as would, perhaps, trouble a woman.)

(5828%&%[Stabs the King, who is borne away by his attendants, mortally wounded, R.H.U.E.])
