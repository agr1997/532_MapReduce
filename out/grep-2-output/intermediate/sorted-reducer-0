(1515%&%I.4 The rivals of my watch,] Rivals, for partners or associates.)
(1517%&%I.5 And liegemen to the Dane.] i.e., owing allegiance to Denmark.)
(1531%&%I.12 I might not this believe, &c.] I could not: it had not been permitted me, &c., without the full and perfect evidence, &c.)
(1533%&%I.13 Jump at this dead hour,] Jump and just were synonymous in Shakespeare's time.)
(1535%&%I.14 In what particular thought to work,] In what particular course to set my thoughts at work: in what particular train to direct the mind and exercise it in conjecture.)
(1537%&%I.15 Gross and scope] Upon the whole, and in a general view.)
(1539%&%I.16 Bodes some strange eruption to our state,] i.e., some political distemper, which will break out in dangerous consequences.)
(1551%&%So in Decker's Knight's Conjuring, &c. "If any of them had bound the spirit of gold by any charmes in cares, or in iron fetters, under the ground, they should, for their own soule's quiet (which, questionless, else would whine up and down,) not for the good of their children, release it.")
(1559%&%Apparitions were supposed to fly from the crowing of the cock, because it indicated the approach of day.)
(1571%&%I.26 With a defeated joy,] i.e., with joy baffled; with joy interrupted by grief.)
(1575%&%I.28 Your leave and favour] The favour of your leave granted, the kind permission. Two substantives with a copulative being here, as is the frequent practice of our author, used for an adjective and substantive: an adjective sense is given to a substantive.)
(1577%&%I.29 Upon his will I sealed my hard consent:] At or upon his earnest and importunate suit, I gave my full and final, though hardly obtained and reluctant, consent.)
(1599%&%I.37 That father lost, lost his;] "That lost father (of your father, i.e., your grandfather), or father so lost, lost his.")
(1601%&%I.38 Do obsequious sorrow:] Follow with becoming and ceremonious observance the memory of the deceased.)
(1603%&%I.39 But to perséver] This word was anciently accented on the second syllable.)
(1621%&%I.48 The uses of this world!] i.e., the habitudes and usages of life.)
(1625%&%I.50 Hyperion to a satyr:] An allusion to the exquisite beauty of Apollo, compared with the deformity of a satyr; that satyr, perhaps, being Pan, the brother of Apollo. Our great poet is here guilty of a false quantity, by calling Hypĕrīon, Hypērĭon, a mistake not unusual among our English poets.)
(1629%&%I.52 I'll change that name with you.] i.e., do not call yourself my servant, you are my friend; so I shall call you, and so I would have you call me.)
(1647%&%i.e., suppress your astonishment for a short time, that you may be the better able to give your attention to what we will relate.)

(1731%&%I.97 Beetles o'er his base into the sea,] i.e., projects darkly over the sea.)
(1733%&%I.98 Némean lion's nerve.] Shakespeare, and nearly all the poets of his time, disregarded the quantity of Latin names. The poet has here placed the accent on the first syllable, instead of the second.)
(1735%&%I.99 That lets me:] To let, in the sense in which it is here used, means to hinder—to obstruct—to oppose. The word is derived from the Saxon.)
(1737%&%I.100 To fast in fires,] Chaucer has a similar passage with regard to eternal punishment—"And moreover the misery of Hell shall be in default of meat and drink.")
(1757%&%I.110 Hebenon] Hebenon is described by Nares in his Glossary, as the juice of ebony, supposed to be a deadly poison.)
(1771%&%I.117 Come, bird, come.] This is the call which falconers used to their hawk in the air when they would have him come down to them.)
(1773%&%I.118 There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark— But he's an arrant knave.] Hamlet probably begins these words in the ardour of confidence and sincerity; but suddenly alarmed at the magnitude of the disclosure he was going to make, and considering that, not his friend Horatio only, but another person was present, he breaks off suddenly:—"There's ne'er a villain in all Denmark that can match (perhaps he would have said) my uncle in villainy; but recollecting the danger of such a declaration, he pauses for a moment, and then abruptly concludes:—"but he's an arrant knave.")
(1775%&%I.119 Whirling words,] Random words thrown out with no specific aim.)

(189%&%[Horatio crosses in front of the Ghost to R. Ghost crosses to L.])
(1944%&%Pol. Now do I think (or else this brain of mine)
(2044%&%Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,)
(2156%&%Ham. Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten thousand.)
(2178%&%Ham. Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue28 says here that old men have grey beards; that their faces are 39wrinkled; their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams: All of which, sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down; for yourself, sir, shall be as old as I am, if, like a crab, you could go backward.)
(2187%&%Pol. (L.) Indeed, that is out o' the air.—How pregnant sometimes his replies29 are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter.—My honourable lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.)
(2189%&%Ham. (C.) You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will more willingly part withall, except my life, except my life, except my life.)
(2196%&%Pol. (Without.) You go to seek the lord Hamlet; there he is.)
(22%&%Fran. For this relief much thanks: [Crosses to L.] 'tis bitter cold,)
(2206%&%Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? [Crosses to Rosencrantz.] Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both? What news?)
(2208%&%Ros. (L.) None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.)
(2222%&%Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights of our fellowship, [taking their hands,] by the consonancy of our youth,31 by the obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer32 could charge you withal, be even33 and direct with me, whether you were sent for, or no?)
(2237%&%Ham. (Returning C.) I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather.35 I have of late (but wherefore I know not) lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and, indeed, it goes so heavily with my disposition, that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a steril promontory; this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this 41majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason! how infinite in faculties! in form and moving how express36 and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world! the paragon37 of animals! And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not me,—nor woman neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.)
(2239%&%Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.)
(2253%&%42Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is king of Denmark,43 and those that would make mouths at him44 while my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.45 There is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out.)
(2259%&%Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands. You are welcome: but my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.)
(2271%&%Ros. (R.) Haply he's the second time come to them; for they say an old man is twice a child.)
(2273%&%Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players; mark it.—You say right, sir: o'Monday morning; 'twas then, indeed.)
(2279%&%Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in Rome,——)
(2307%&%Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I love passing well.)
(2321%&%Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once,—but it was never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas caviare to the general:59 but it was an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning.60 One speech in it I chiefly loved; 'twas Æneas' tale to Dido; and thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of Priam's slaughter: If it live in your memory, begin at this line; let me see, let me see;—)
(2323%&%The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,—'tis not so: it begins with Pyrrhus:)
(2332%&%Pol. (R.) 'Fore Heaven, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion.)
(2374%&%Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.— Say on;—come to Hecuba.)
(2376%&%1st Play. But who, ah woe, had seen the mobled queen—)
(2411%&%Old friend [Crosses to C.] —My good friends [To Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.] I'll leave you till night: you are welcome to Elsinore—can you play the murder of Gonzago?)
(2417%&%Ham. We'll have it to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which I would insert in't—could you not?)
(2565%&%i.e., this must be made known to the king, for (being kept secret) the hiding Hamlet's love might occasion more mischief to us from him and the queen, than the uttering or revealing of it will occasion hate and resentment from Hamlet.)
(2567%&%It was the custom of Shakespeare's age, to conclude acts and scenes with a couplet, a custom which was continued for nearly a century afterwards.)
(2569%&%II.5 The understanding of himself,] i.e., the just estimate of himself.)
(2583%&%II.12 Most beautified Ophelia,] Heywood, in his History of Edward VI., says "Katharine Parre, Queen Dowager to King Henry VIII., was a woman beautified with many excellent virtues." The same expression is frequently used by other old authors.)
(2585%&%II.13 In her excellent white bosom,] The ladies, in Shakespeare's time, wore pockets in the front of their stays.)
(2587%&%II.14 These, &c.] In our poet's time, the word these was usually added at the end of the superscription of letters.)
(2589%&%II.15 I am ill at these numbers;] No talent for these rhymes.)
(2611%&%II.26 You are a fishmonger.] This was an expression better understood in Shakespeare's time than at present, and no doubt was relished by the audience of the Globe Theatre as applicable to the Papists, who in Queen Elizabeth's time were esteemed enemies to the Government. Hence the proverbial phrase of He's an honest man and eats no fish; to signify he's a friend to the Government and a Protestant.)
(2613%&%II.27 For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god, kissing carrion,——Have you a daughter?] i.e., Hamlet having just remarked that honesty is very rare in the world, adds, that since there is so little virtue, since corruption abounds everywhere, and maggots are bred by the sun, which is a god, even in a dead dog, Polonius ought to take care to prevent his daughter from walking in the sun, lest she should prove "a breeder of sinners;" for though conception (understanding) in general be a blessing, yet as Ophelia might chance to conceive (to be pregnant), it might be a calamity. Hamlet's abrupt question, "Have you a daughter?" is evidently intended to impress Polonius with the belief of the Prince's madness.—Malone.)
(2615%&%II.28 The satirical rogue] Hamlet alludes to Juvenal, who in his 10th Satire, describes the evils of long life.)
(2619%&%II.30 Beaten way of friendship,] Plain track, open and unceremonious course.)
(2635%&%II.38 Lenten entertainment] i.e., sparing, like the entertainments given in Lent.)
(2637%&%II.39 We coted them on the way;] To cote, is to pass by, to pass the side of another. It appears to be a word of French origin, and was a common sporting term in Shakespeare's time.)
(2639%&%II.40 The humorous man shall end his part in peace;] The fretful or capricious man shall vent the whole of his spleen undisturbed.)
(2651%&%II.46 I know a hawk from a hern-shaw.] A hernshaw is a heron or hern. To know a hawk from a hernshaw is an ancient proverb, sometimes corrupted into handsaw. Spencer quotes the proverb, as meaning, wise enough to know the hawk from its game.)
(2653%&%II.47 Buz, buz!] Sir William Blackstone states that buz used to be an interjection at Oxford when any one began a story that was generally known before.)
(2655%&%II.48 Then came each actor on his ass.] This seems to be a line of a ballad.)
(2657%&%II.49 Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light.] An English translation of the tragedies of Seneca was published in 1581, and one comedy of Plautus, viz., the Menœchme, in 1595.)
(2659%&%II.50 For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men.] The probable meaning of this passage is,—For the observance of the rules of the Drama, while they take such liberties, as are allowable, they are the only men—writ is an old word for writing.)
(2671%&%II.56 By the altitude of a chopine.] A chioppine is a high shoe, or rather clog, worn by the Italians. Venice was more famous for them than any other place. They are described as having been made of wood covered with coloured leather, and sometimes even half a yard high, their altitude being proportioned to the rank of the lady, so that they could not walk without being supported.)
(2673%&%II.57 Like French falconers,] The French seem to have been the first and noblest falconers in the western part of Europe. The French king sent over his falconers to show that sport to King James the First. —See Weldon's Court of King James.)
(2677%&%II.59 Caviare to the general;] Caviare is the spawn of fish pickled, salted, and dried. It is imported from Russia, and was considered in the time of Shakespeare a new and fashionable luxury, not obtained or relished by the vulgar, and therefore used by him to signify anything above their comprehension—general is here used for the people.)
(2679%&%II.60 As much modesty as cunning.] As much propriety and decorum as skill.)
(2695%&%II.65 His whole functions suiting with forms to his conceit?] i.e., his powers and faculties—the whole energies of his soul and body giving material forms to his passion, such as tone of voice, expression of face, requisite action, in accordance with the ideas that floated in his conceit or imagination.)
(2699%&%II.67 Like John a-dreams,] Or dreaming John, a name apparently coined to suit a dreaming, stupid person; he seems to have been a well-known character.)
(2701%&%II.68 Unpregnant of my cause,] i.e., not quickened with a new desire of vengeance; not teeming with revenge.)
(2705%&%II.70 Lack gall to make oppression bitter;] i.e., lack gall to make me feel the bitterness of oppression.)
(2723%&%Enter King and Queen, preceded by Polonius. Ophelia, Rosencrantz, and Giuldenstern, following (R.H.))
(2846%&%Ham. To be, or not to be, that is the question:8)
(2912%&%And lose the name of action.22 [—Ophelia returns.—] Soft you now!23)
(2961%&%Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd, than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness:26 this was some time a paradox, but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.)
(2965%&%Ham. You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock, but we shall relish of it:27 I loved you not.)
(2969%&%Ham. Get thee to a nunnery: Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest; but yet I could accuse me of such things, that it were better my mother had not borne me: I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my beck28 than I have thoughts to put them in,29 imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I do, crawling between earth and heaven? 54We are arrant knaves, all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your father?)
(2981%&%Ham. I have heard of your paintings30 too, well enough; Heaven hath given you one face, and you make yourselves another:31 you jig, you amble, and you lisp,32 and nickname Heaven's creatures, and make your wantonness your ignorance.33 Go to, I'll no more of't; it hath made me mad. [Hamlet crosses to R.H.] I say, we will have no more marriages: those that are married already, all but one,34 shall live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery, go.)
(3061%&%Ham. (C.) Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it, as many of our players do, I had as lief42 the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hands thus;43 but use all gently: for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say) whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul, to hear a robustious perrywig-pated fellow44 tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings,45 who, for the most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise: I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant;46 it out-herods Herod:47 Pray you, avoid it.)
(3065%&%Ham. Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your tutor; suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, 57scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time its form and pressure.48 Now, this overdone, or come tardy off,49 though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of which one50 must, in your allowance,51 o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,52 that, neither having the accent of christians, nor the gait of christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed, that I have thought some of nature's journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.)
(3069%&%1st Play. (L.) I hope we have reformed that indifferently53 with us.)
(3160%&%King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not mine.65)
(3162%&%Ham. No, nor mine, now.66 My lord,—you played once in the university, you say?67 [To Polonius, L.])
(3164%&%Pol. (L.C.) That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.)
(3168%&%Pol. I did enact Julius Cæsar:68 I was killed i'the Capitol; Brutus killed me.)
(3216%&%61Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?75)
(3232%&%P. Queen. (L.) So many journeys may the sun and moon)
(325%&%Ham. (L.) A little more than kin, and less than kind.31)
(3267%&%P. King. I do believe you think what now you speak;)
(329%&%13King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?)
(3324%&%Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see the puppets dallying.87 Begin, murderer; leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:—)
(3344%&%Ham. He poisons him i' the garden for his estate. His name's Gonzago: the story is extant, and written in very choice Italian: You shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago's wife.)
(3375%&%Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (L.H.) Hamlet seats himself in the chair (R.))
(3377%&%Guil. (L.C.) Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.)
(3391%&%Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more rich to signify this to the doctor; for, for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into more choler.)
(3393%&%Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start not so wildly from my affair.)
(3397%&%Guil. The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit, hath sent me to you.)
(3401%&%Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed. If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do your mother's commandment: if not, your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business.)
(3407%&%Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased! But, sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command: or rather as you say, my mother: therefore no more, but to the matter: My mother, you say,—)
(3409%&%65Ros. (Crosses to C.) Then thus she says: Your behaviour hath struck her into amazement and admiration.93)
(3423%&%Ros. (R.) Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you do, surely, bar the door of your own liberty, if you deny your griefs to your friend.96)
(3427%&%Ros. How can that be, when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in Denmark?97)
(3429%&%Ham. Ay, sir, but While the grass grows,—the proverb is something musty.98)
(3441%&%Ham. (C.) I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?)
(3463%&%Pol. (R.) My lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently.)
(3465%&%67Ham. (C.) Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?)
(3609%&%Queen. Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.)
(3867%&%[Exit Ghost, L.H. Hamlet sinks into chair C. The Queen falls on her knees by his side.])
(3953%&%III.8 To be, or not to be, that is the question:] Hamlet is deliberating whether he should continue to live, or put an end to his existence.)
(3955%&%III.9 Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,] A sea of troubles among the Greeks grew into a proverbial usage; so that the expression figuratively means, the troubles of human life, which flow in upon us, and encompass us round like a sea.)
(3957%&%III.10 This mortal coil,] Coil is here used in each of its senses, that of turmoil or bustle, and that which entwines or wraps round.)
(3964%&%That makes calamity of so long life;] The consideration that makes the evils of life so long submitted to, lived under.)
(3966%&%III.13 The whips and scorns of time,] Those sufferings of body and mind, those stripes and mortifications to which, in its course, the life of man is subjected.)
(3980%&%III.20 Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;] A state of doubt and uncertainty, a conscious feeling or apprehension, a misgiving "How our audit stands.")
(3982%&%III.21 Of great pith and moment,] i.e., of great vigour and importance.)
(3991%&%III.23 Soft you now!] A gentler pace! have done with lofty march!)
(3993%&%III.24 Nymph, in thy orisons] i.e., in thy prayers. Orison is from oraison—French.)
(3995%&%III.25 If you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.] i.e., if you really possess these qualities, chastity and beauty, and mean to support the character of both, your honesty should be so chary of your beauty, as not to suffer a thing so fragile to entertain discourse, or to be parleyed with.)
(3997%&%The lady interprets the words otherwise, giving them the turn best suited to her purpose.)
(3999%&%III.26 His likeness:] Shakespeare and his contemporaries frequently use the personal for the neutral pronoun.)
(4011%&%III.32 You jig, you amble, and you lisp,] This is an allusion to the manners of the age, which Shakespeare, in the spirit of his contemporaries, means here to satirise.)
(4013%&%III.33 Make your wantonness your ignorance.] You mistake by wanton affectation, and pretend to mistake by ignorance.)
(4017%&%III.35 To a nunnery, go. Exit Hamlet.] There is no doubt that Hamlet's attachment to Ophelia is ardent and sincere, but he treats her with apparent severity because he is aware that Ophelia has been purposely thrown in his way; that spies are about them; and that it is necessary for the preservation of his life, to assume a conduct which he thought would be attributed to madness only.)
(4019%&%III.36 The expectancy and rose of the fair state,] The first hope and fairest flower. "The gracious mark o' the land.")
(4035%&%III.44 Robustious perrywig-pated fellow] This is a ridicule on the quantity of false hair worn in Shakespeare's time, for wigs were not in common use till the reign of Charles the Second. Robustious means making an extravagant show of passion.)
(4037%&%III.45 The ears of the groundlings,] The meaner people appear to have occupied the pit of the theatre (which had neither floor nor benches in Shakespeare's time), as they now sit in the upper gallery.)
(4039%&%III.46 O'er-doing Termagant;] The Crusaders, and those who celebrated them, confounded Mahometans with Pagans, and supposed Mahomet, or Mahound, to be one of their deities, and Tervagant or Termagant, another. This imaginary personage was introduced into our old plays and moralities, and represented as of a most violent character, so that a ranting actor might always appear to advantage in it. The word is now used for a scolding woman.)
(4051%&%III.52 Not to speak it profanely,] i.e., irreverently, in allusion to Hamlet's supposition that God had not made such men, but that they were only the handy work of God's assistants.)
(4055%&%III.54 Speak no more them is set down for them:] Shakespeare alludes to a custom of his time, when the clown, or low comedian, as he would now be called, addressing the audience during the play, entered into a contest of raillery and sarcasm with such spectators as chose to engage with him.)
(4071%&%III.62 Occulted guilt do not itself unkennel] Stifled, secret guilt, do not develope itself.)
(4073%&%III.63 As Vulcan's stithy.] A stithy is the smith's shop, as stith is the anvil.)
(4075%&%III.64 In censure of his seeming.] In making our estimate of the appearance he shall put on.)
(4077%&%III.65 I have nothing with this answer; these words are not mine.] i.e., they grow not out of mine: have no relation to anything said by me.)
(4079%&%III.66 No, nor mine, now.] They are now anybody's. Dr. Johnson observes, "a man's words, says the proverb, are his own no longer than while he keeps them unspoken.")
(4091%&%III.72 For I'll have a suit of sables.] Wherever his scene might be, the customs of his country were ever in Shakespeare's thoughts.

(5076%&%1st Clo. How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence?)
(5090%&%2nd Clo. Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out of christian burial.)
(5092%&%1st Clo. Why, there thou say'st:10 And the more pity that great folks should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves, more than their even christian.11 Come, my spade.

(5182%&%1st Clo. You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is not yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.)
(5184%&%Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't, and say it is thine: 'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.)
(5186%&%1st. Clo. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again, from me to you.)

Where be your gibes now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning? Quite chap-fallen? Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this favour26 she must come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing.)
(5263%&%Ham. To what base uses may we return, Horatio! Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander, till it find it stopping a bung-hole?)
(5267%&%Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: As thus; Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth to dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make loam; And why of that loam, whereto he was converted, might they not stop a beer barrel?)
(5300%&%1st Priest. (R. of the grave.) Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd)

(5526%&%Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.52 Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and great showing:53 Indeed, to speak feelingly of him,54 he is the card or calendar of gentry,55 98for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see.56)
(5546%&%Osr. The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary horses: against the which he has imponed,59 as I take it, six French rapiers and poignards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers,60 or so: Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit.61)
(5560%&%Ham. Sir, it is the breathing time of day with me; let the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose, I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.)
(5564%&%Ham. To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.)
(5580%&%Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury: there is a special providence in the fall of a sparrow.)
(5654%&%Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?)
(5768%&%[Laertes wounds Hamlet; then, in scuffling they change Rapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes.])
