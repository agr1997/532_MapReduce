(3065%&%Ham. Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your tutor; suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, 57scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time its form and pressure.48 Now, this overdone, or come tardy off,49 though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of which one50 must, in your allowance,51 o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,52 that, neither having the accent of christians, nor the gait of christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed, that I have thought some of nature's journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.)

(3160%&%King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not mine.65)
(3162%&%Ham. No, nor mine, now.66 My lord,—you played once in the university, you say?67 [To Polonius, L.])
(3164%&%Pol. (L.C.) That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.)
(3168%&%Pol. I did enact Julius Cæsar:68 I was killed i'the Capitol; Brutus killed me.)
(3216%&%61Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?75)
(3232%&%P. Queen. (L.) So many journeys may the sun and moon)
(3267%&%P. King. I do believe you think what now you speak;)
(3324%&%Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see the puppets dallying.87 Begin, murderer; leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:—)
(3344%&%Ham. He poisons him i' the garden for his estate. His name's Gonzago: the story is extant, and written in very choice Italian: You shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago's wife.)
(3375%&%Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (L.H.) Hamlet seats himself in the chair (R.))
(3377%&%Guil. (L.C.) Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.)
(3391%&%Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more rich to signify this to the doctor; for, for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into more choler.)
(3393%&%Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start not so wildly from my affair.)
(3397%&%Guil. The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit, hath sent me to you.)
(3401%&%Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed. If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do your mother's commandment: if not, your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business.)
(3407%&%Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased! But, sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command: or rather as you say, my mother: therefore no more, but to the matter: My mother, you say,—)
(3409%&%65Ros. (Crosses to C.) Then thus she says: Your behaviour hath struck her into amazement and admiration.93)
(3423%&%Ros. (R.) Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you do, surely, bar the door of your own liberty, if you deny your griefs to your friend.96)
(3427%&%Ros. How can that be, when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in Denmark?97)
(3429%&%Ham. Ay, sir, but While the grass grows,—the proverb is something musty.98)
(3441%&%Ham. (C.) I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?)
(3463%&%Pol. (R.) My lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently.)
(3465%&%67Ham. (C.) Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?)
(3609%&%Queen. Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.)
(3867%&%[Exit Ghost, L.H. Hamlet sinks into chair C. The Queen falls on her knees by his side.])
(3953%&%III.8 To be, or not to be, that is the question:] Hamlet is deliberating whether he should continue to live, or put an end to his existence.)
(3955%&%III.9 Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,] A sea of troubles among the Greeks grew into a proverbial usage; so that the expression figuratively means, the troubles of human life, which flow in upon us, and encompass us round like a sea.)
(3957%&%III.10 This mortal coil,] Coil is here used in each of its senses, that of turmoil or bustle, and that which entwines or wraps round.)
(3964%&%That makes calamity of so long life;] The consideration that makes the evils of life so long submitted to, lived under.)
(3966%&%III.13 The whips and scorns of time,] Those sufferings of body and mind, those stripes and mortifications to which, in its course, the life of man is subjected.)

(3993%&%III.24 Nymph, in thy orisons] i.e., in thy prayers. Orison is from oraison—French.)
(3995%&%III.25 If you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.] i.e., if you really possess these qualities, chastity and beauty, and mean to support the character of both, your honesty should be so chary of your beauty, as not to suffer a thing so fragile to entertain discourse, or to be parleyed with.)
(3997%&%The lady interprets the words otherwise, giving them the turn best suited to her purpose.)
(3999%&%III.26 His likeness:] Shakespeare and his contemporaries frequently use the personal for the neutral pronoun.)
(4011%&%III.32 You jig, you amble, and you lisp,] This is an allusion to the manners of the age, which Shakespeare, in the spirit of his contemporaries, means here to satirise.)
(4013%&%III.33 Make your wantonness your ignorance.] You mistake by wanton affectation, and pretend to mistake by ignorance.)
(4017%&%III.35 To a nunnery, go. Exit Hamlet.] There is no doubt that Hamlet's attachment to Ophelia is ardent and sincere, but he treats her with apparent severity because he is aware that Ophelia has been purposely thrown in his way; that spies are about them; and that it is necessary for the preservation of his life, to assume a conduct which he thought would be attributed to madness only.)
(4019%&%III.36 The expectancy and rose of the fair state,] The first hope and fairest flower. "The gracious mark o' the land.")
(4035%&%III.44 Robustious perrywig-pated fellow] This is a ridicule on the quantity of false hair worn in Shakespeare's time, for wigs were not in common use till the reign of Charles the Second. Robustious means making an extravagant show of passion.)
(4037%&%III.45 The ears of the groundlings,] The meaner people appear to have occupied the pit of the theatre (which had neither floor nor benches in Shakespeare's time), as they now sit in the upper gallery.)
(4039%&%III.46 O'er-doing Termagant;] The Crusaders, and those who celebrated them, confounded Mahometans with Pagans, and supposed Mahomet, or Mahound, to be one of their deities, and Tervagant or Termagant, another. This imaginary personage was introduced into our old plays and moralities, and represented as of a most violent character, so that a ranting actor might always appear to advantage in it. The word is now used for a scolding woman.)
(4051%&%III.52 Not to speak it profanely,] i.e., irreverently, in allusion to Hamlet's supposition that God had not made such men, but that they were only the handy work of God's assistants.)
(4055%&%III.54 Speak no more them is set down for them:] Shakespeare alludes to a custom of his time, when the clown, or low comedian, as he would now be called, addressing the audience during the play, entered into a contest of raillery and sarcasm with such spectators as chose to engage with him.)

(4079%&%III.66 No, nor mine, now.] They are now anybody's. Dr. Johnson observes, "a man's words, says the proverb, are his own no longer than while he keeps them unspoken.")
(4091%&%III.72 For I'll have a suit of sables.] Wherever his scene might be, the customs of his country were ever in Shakespeare's thoughts. A suit trimmed with sables was in our author's own time the richest dress worn by men in England. By the Statute of Apparel, 24 Henry VIII., c. 13, (article furres), it is ordained, that none under the degree of an Earl may use sables.)
(4093%&%III.73 He must build churches, then.] Such benefactors to society were sure to be recorded by means of the feast day on which the patron saints and founders of churches were commemorated in every parish. This custom has long since ceased.)
(4095%&%III.74 Miching mallecho;] To mich is a provincial word, signifying to lie hid, or to skulk, or act by stealth. It was probably once generally used. Mallecho is supposed to be corrupted from the Spanish Malechor, which means a poisoner.)
(4097%&%III.75 The posy of a ring?] Such poetry as you may find engraven on a ring.)
(4101%&%III.77 Tellus' orbèd ground,] i.e., the globe of the earth. Tellus is the personification of the earth, being described as the first being that sprung from Chaos.)

(4121%&%III.85 Our withers are unwrung.] Withers is the joining of the shoulder bones at the bottom of the neck and mane of a horse. Unwrung is not pinched.)
(4123%&%III.86 You are as good as a chorus,] The persons who are supposed to behold what passes in the acts of a tragedy, and sing their sentiments between the acts.)
(4125%&%The use to which Shakespeare converted the chorus, may be seen in King Henry V.)
(4127%&%III.87 I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see the puppets dallying.] This refers to the interpreter, who formerly sat on the stage at all puppet shows, and explained to the audience. The puppets dallying are here made to signify to the agitations of Ophelia's bosom.)
(4143%&%III.91 Let the strucken deer go weep,] Shakespeare, in As you like it, in allusion to the wounded stag, speaks of the big round tears which cours'd one another down his innocent nose in piteous chase. In the 13th song of Drayton's Polyolbion, is a similar passage—"The harte weepeth at his dying; his tears are held to be precious in medicine.")
(4161%&%III.100 Why do you go about to recover the wind of me,] Equivalent to our more modern saying of Get on the blind side.)
(4165%&%III.102 If my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.] If my sense of duty have led me too far, it is affection and regard for you that makes the carriage of that duty border on disrespect.)

(4169%&%III.104 Though you can fret me, you cannot play upon me.] A fret is a stop or key of a musical instrument. Here is, therefore, a play upon the words. Though you cannot fret, stop, or vex, you cannot play or impose upon me.)
(4183%&%III.111 The speech of vantage.] i.e., opportunity or advantage of secret observations.)
(4189%&%III.114 I'll 'sconce me even here.] 'Sconce and ensconce are constantly used figuratively for hide. In "The Merry Wives of Windsor," Falstaff says, "I will ensconce me behind the arras.")
(4215%&%This alludes to Pharaoh's dream, in the 41st chapter of Genesis.)
(4219%&%III.126 Hey-day in the blood] This expression is occasionally used by old authors.)
(4231%&%III.130 A vice of kings;] i.e., a low mimick of kings. The vice was the fool of the old moralities or dramas, who was generally engaged in contests with the devil, by whom he was finally carried away. Dr. Johnson says the modern Punch is descended from the vice.)
(4239%&%In allusion to the usurper procuring the crown as a common pilferer or thief, and not by open villainy that carried danger with it.)
(4251%&%III.137 Nothing at all; yet all that is, I see.] It is in perfect consistency with the belief that all spirits were not only naturally invisible, but that they possessed the power of making themselves visible to such persons only as they pleased.)

(4273%&%When you are desirous to receive a blessing from heaven (which you cannot, seriously, till you reform), I will beg to receive a blessing from you.)

(4596%&%Laer. (R.) That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;)
(4691%&%Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance;24 pray you, love, remember: and there is pansies,25 that's for thoughts.)
(4695%&%Oph. There's fennel for you, (crosses to the King on L.H.) and columbines:26 there's rue for you; (turns to the Queen, 82who is R.C.) and here's some for me:—we may call it herb of grace o'Sundays:27—you may wear your rue with a difference.28—There's a daisy:29—I would give you some violets,30 but they withered all when my father died:—They say he made a good end,——)
(4699%&%Laer. (R.) Thought and affliction,32 passion, hell itself, She turns to favour and to prettiness.)
(4723%&%And of all christian souls, I pray Heaven. Heaven be wi' you.)
(4776%&%[Reads.] High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on your kingdom.37 To morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden and more strange return.)
(4956%&%IV.3 Where the offender's scourge is weigh'd, But never the offence.] When an offender is popular, the people never consider what his crime was, but they scrutinise his punishment.)
(4970%&%IV.10 His sandal shoon.] Shoon is the old plural of shoe. The verse is descriptive of a pilgrim. While this kind of devotion was in favour, love intrigues were carried on under that mask.)

(4990%&%IV.20 My will, not all the world's:] i.e., by my will as far as my will is concerned, not all the world shall stop me; and, as for my means, I'll husband them so well, they shall go far, though really little.)
(4994%&%IV.22 You must sing Down-a-down,] This was the burthen of an old song, well known in Shakespeare's time.)
(4996%&%IV.23 How well the wheel becomes it!] This probably means that the song or charm is well adapted to those who are occupied at spinning at the wheel.)
(4998%&%IV.24 There's rosemary, that's for remembrance;] Rosemary was anciently supposed to strengthen the memory, and was carried at funerals and wore at weddings. It was also considered the emblem of fidelity in lovers; and at weddings it was usual to dip the rosemary in the cup, and drink to the health of the new married couple.)
(5012%&%IV.31 For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy,—] Part of an old song.)
(5014%&%IV.32 Thought and affliction,] Thought here, as in many other places, means melancholy.)
(5016%&%IV.33 I must commune with your grief,] i.e., confer, discuss, or argue with.)
(5018%&%IV.34 No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,] Not only the sword, but the helmet, gauntlet, spurs, and tabard, (i.e., a coat whereon the armorial ensigns were anciently depicted, from whence the term coat of armour), are hung over the grave of every knight.)

(5072%&%1st Clo. (R.) Is she to be buried in christian burial that wilfully seeks her own salvation?)
(5074%&%2nd Clo. (L.) I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight:2 the crowner3 hath set on her, and finds it christian burial.)
(5076%&%1st Clo. How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence?)
(5090%&%2nd Clo. Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out of christian burial.)
(5092%&%1st Clo. Why, there thou say'st:10 And the more pity that great folks should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves, more than their even christian.11 Come, my spade. There is no ancient gentlemen but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers: they hold up Adam's profession.)
(5096%&%1st Clo. He was the first that ever bore arms. I'll put another question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the purpose, confess thyself——13)
(5100%&%1st Clo. What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?)
(5102%&%2nd Clo. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.)
(5104%&%1st Clo. I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows does well; But how does it well? it does well to those that do ill: now, thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church: argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.)
(5106%&%2nd Clo. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?)
(5155%&%Ham. Did these bones cost no more the breeding, but to play at loggats with them?19 mine ache to think on't.)
(5180%&%Ham. (R. of grave.) I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't.)
(5182%&%1st Clo. You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is not yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.)
(5184%&%Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't, and say it is thine: 'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.)
(5186%&%1st. Clo. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again, from me to you.)
(5210%&%1st Clo. Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits there; or, if he do not, 'tis no great matter there.)
(5214%&%1st Clo. 'Twill not be seen in him there; there the men are as mad as he.)
(5230%&%1st Clo. 'Faith, if he be not rotten before he die, he 92will last you some eight year or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.)
(5234%&%1st Clo. Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that he will keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore decayer of your ill-begotten dead body. Here's a skull now, hath lain in the earth three-and-twenty years.)
(5238%&%1st Clo. O, a mad fellow's it was: Whose do you think it was?)
(5249%&%Ham. Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath borne me on his back a thousand times. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft; and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is! Where be your gibes now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning? Quite chap-fallen? Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this favour26 she must come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing.)
(5263%&%Ham. To what base uses may we return, Horatio! Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander, till it find it stopping a bung-hole?)
(5267%&%Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: As thus; Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth to dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make loam; And why of that loam, whereto he was converted, might they not stop a beer barrel?)
(5300%&%1st Priest. (R. of the grave.) Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd)
(5506%&%Ham. Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to know him.)
(5508%&%Osr. (L.) Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart a thing to you from his majesty.)
(5520%&%Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere,—I cannot tell how.—But, my lord, his majesty bade me signify to you, that he has laid a great wager on your head: Sir, this is the matter,—)
(5526%&%Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.52 Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and great showing:53 Indeed, to speak feelingly of him,54 he is the card or calendar of gentry,55 98for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see.56)
(5546%&%Osr. The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary horses: against the which he has imponed,59 as I take it, six French rapiers and poignards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers,60 or so: Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit.61)
(5560%&%Ham. Sir, it is the breathing time of day with me; let the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose, I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.)
(5564%&%Ham. To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.)
(5580%&%Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury: there is a special providence in the fall of a sparrow.)
(5654%&%Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?)
(5768%&%[Laertes wounds Hamlet; then, in scuffling they change Rapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes.])
(5841%&%Ham. (C.) Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.)
(5869%&%Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have it.)
