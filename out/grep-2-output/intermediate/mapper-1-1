(3071%&%Ham. O, reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them:54 for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators55 to laugh too; though, in the mean time, some necessary question56 of the play be then to be considered: that's villainous, and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.)
(3093%&%To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?)
(3154%&%March. Enter King and Queen, preceded by Polonius, Ophelia, Horatio, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, Lords, Ladies, and Attendants. King and Queen sit (L.H.); Ophelia (R.H.))
(3158%&%Ham. (C.) Excellent, i'faith; of the cameleon's dish: I eat the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.)
(3170%&%Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there.—Be the players ready?)
(3190%&%Ham. O, your only jig-maker.71 What should a man do but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.)
(3194%&%Ham. So long? Nay, then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a suit of sables.72 O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half a year: But, by'r-lady, he must build churches, then.73)
(3224%&%P. King. (R.) Full thirty times hath Phœbus' cart76 gone round)

(3275%&%62P. Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!)
(3310%&%King. Have you heard the argument?80 Is there no offence in't?)
(3312%&%Ham. No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i'the world.)
(3316%&%Ham. The mouse-trap.81 Marry, how? Tropically.82 This play is the image of a murder83 done in Vienna: Gonzago is the Duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you shall see anon;—'tis a knavish piece of work: but what of that? your majesty, and we that have free souls, it touches us not: Let the galled jade wince,84 our withers85 are unwrung.)
(3363%&%O, good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand pounds. Didst perceive?)
(3411%&%Ham. O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration?—impart.)
(3413%&%Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you go to bed.)
(3415%&%Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any further trade with us?94)
(3435%&%[Exeunt Horatio and Musicians R.H. Guildenstern, after speaking privately to Rosencrantz, crosses behind Hamlet to R.H.])
(3437%&%66Why do you go about to recover the wind of me,100 as if you would drive me into a toil?101)
(3439%&%Guil. (R.) O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.102)
(3453%&%Ham. 'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with your fingers and thumb, give it breath with your mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music.103 Look you, these are the stops.)
(3455%&%Guil. But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony; I have not the skill.)
(3457%&%Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass: and there is much music, excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot you make it speak. 'Sdeath, do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me, you cannot play upon me.104)
(3477%&%Ham. Then will I come to my mother by and by. They fool me to the top of my bent.105 I will come by and by.)
(3512%&%King. I like him not; nor stands it safe with us107)
(3565%&%Pol. He will come straight. Look, you lay home to him:112)
(3567%&%Tell him his pranks have been too broad113 to bear with,)
(3611%&%Ham. Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;)
(3675%&%Queen. (Sits R.C.) What have I done, that thou dar'st wag thy tongue)
(3790%&%Save me [Starts from his chair], and hover o'er me with your wings,)
(3798%&%Ham. (L.) Do you not come your tardy son to chide,)
(3947%&%III.5 May here affront Ophelia:] To affront is to come face to face—to confront.)

(3974%&%III.17 Who would fardels bear,] Fardel is a burden. Fardellus, low Latin.)
(3978%&%III.19 No traveller returns,] The traveller whom Hamlet had seen, though he appeared in the same habit which he had worn in his life-time, was nothing but a shadow, "invulnerable as the air," and, consequently, incorporeal. The Ghost has given us no account of the region from whence he came, being, as he himself informed us, "forbid to tell the secrets of his prison-house."—Malone.)
(3989%&%From this sole consideration have their drifts diverted, and lose the character and name of enterprise.)
(4001%&%III.27 Inoculate our old stock, but we shall relish of it:] So change the original constitution and properties, as that no smack of them shall remain. "Inoculate our stock" are terms in gardening.)

(4041%&%III.47 It out-herods Herod:] In all the old moralities and mysteries this personage was always represented as a tyrant of a very violent temper, using the most exaggerated language. Hence the expression.)
(4043%&%III.48 The very age and body of the time its form and pressure.] i.e., to delineate exactly the manners of the age, and the particular humours of the day—pressure signifying resemblance, as in a print.)
(4045%&%III.49 Come tardy off,] Without spirit or animation; heavily, sleepily done.)

(4067%&%III.60 Whose blood and judgment] Dr. Johnson says that according to the doctrine of the four humours, desire and confidence were seated in the blood, and judgment in the phlegm, and the due mixture of the humours made a perfect character.)
(4069%&%III.61 The very comment of thy soul] The most intense direction of every faculty.)
(4081%&%III.67 You played once in the university, you say?] The practice of acting Latin plays in the universities of Oxford and Cambridge is very ancient, and continued to near the middle of the last century.)
(4083%&%III.68 I did enact Julius Cæsar:] A Latin play on the subject of Cæsar's death, was performed at Christ-church, Oxford, in 1582.)
(4085%&%III.69 They stay upon your patience.] Patience is here used for leisure.)
(4087%&%III.70 Lying down at Ophelia's feet.] To lie at the feet of a mistress during any dramatic representation, seems to have been a common act of gallantry.)
(4089%&%III.71 Jig-maker,] Writer of ludicrous interludes. A jig was not in Shakespeare's time only a dance, but a ludicrous dialogue in metre; many historical ballads were also called jigs.)
(4117%&%III.83 The image of a murder,] i.e., the lively portraiture, the correct and faithful representation of a murder, &c.)
(4135%&%i.e., begin without more delay; for the raven, foreknowing the deed, is already croaking, and, as it were, calling out for the revenge which will ensue.)
(4137%&%III.89 Midnight weeds] The force of the epithet midnight, will be best displayed by a corresponding passage in Macbeth:)
(4151%&%III.95 By these pickers and stealers.] i.e., by these hands. The phrase is taken from the Church catechism, where, in our duty to our neighbour, we are taught to keep our hands from picking and stealing.)

(4157%&%III.98 "While the grass grows,"—the proverb is something musty.] The proverb is, "While the grass grows, the steed starves." Hamlet alludes to his own position, while waiting for his succession to the throne of Denmark. A similar adage is, "A slip between the cup and the lip.")

(4199%&%III.119 Takes off the rose From the fair forehead of an innocent love, And sets a blister there;] i.e., takes the clear tint from the brow of unspotted, untainted innocence. "True or honest as the skin between one's brows" was a proverbial expression, and is frequently used by Shakespeare.)

(4249%&%III.136 My stem effects:] i.e., change the nature of my purposes, or what I mean to effect.)
(4261%&%i.e., "Such shadows are the weak brain's forgeries." Ecstasy in this place, as in many others, means a temporary alienation of mind—a fit.)
(4380%&%Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain convocation of politick worms4 are e'en at him.)
(4384%&%Ham. In Heaven; send thither to see: if your messenger find him not there, seek him i'the other place yourself. But, indeed, if you find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby.)
(4513%&%Oph. Pray, you, let us have no words of this; but when they ask you what it means, say you this:)
(4540%&%Oph. (R.) I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him i'the cold ground. My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies; good night, good night.)
(4544%&%King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.)
(4683%&%Laer. (Coming down R) Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,)

(5002%&%IV.26 There's fennel for you, and columbines:] Fennel was considered an emblem of flattery, and columbine was anciently supposed to be a thankless flower; signifying probably that the courtiers flattered to get favours, and were thankless after receiving them. Columbine was emblematical of forsaken lovers.)
(5004%&%IV.27 There's rue for you; and here's some for me:—we may call it herb of grace o' Sundays:] Probably a quibble is meant here, as rue anciently signified the same as ruth, i.e., sorrow. In the common dictionaries of Shakespeare's time, it was called herb of grace. Ophelia wishes to remind the Queen of the sorrow and contrition she ought to feel for her unlawful marriage; and that she may wear her rue with peculiar propriety on Sundays, when she solicits pardon for the crime which she has so much occasion to rue and repent of.—Malone.)
(5006%&%IV.28 You may wear your rue with a difference.] i.e., to distinguish it from that worn by Ophelia, herself: because her tears flowed from the loss of a father—those of the Queen ought to flow for her guilt.)
(5008%&%IV.29 There's a daisy:] A daisy signified a warning to young women, not to trust the fair promises of their lovers.)
(5020%&%IV.35 Cry to be heard,] All these multiplied incitements are things which cry, &c.)

(5064%&%IV.54 But that this folly drowns it.] i.e., my rage had flamed, if this flood of tears had not extinguished it.)
(5080%&%1st Clo. It must be se offendendo;4 it cannot be else. For here lies the point: If I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and an act hath three branches; it is, to act, to do, and to perform:5 argal,6 she drowned herself wittingly.)
(5084%&%1st Clo. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here stands the man; good: If the man go to this water, and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he goes,8 mark 88you that; but if the water come to him and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.)
(5116%&%1st Clo. Cudgel thy brains no more about it,15 for your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when you are asked this question next, say, a grave-maker, the houses that he makes, last till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan, and fetch me a stoup of liquor.16)
(5132%&%Ham. (Behind the grave.) Has this fellow no feeling of his business, he sings at grave-making?)

(5170%&%Ham. There's another: Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer? Where be his quiddits now, his quillets,21 his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce22 with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of his action of battery? I will speak to this fellow.—Whose grave's this, sirrah?)
(5198%&%1st Clo. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.)
(5200%&%Ham. How absolute the knave is!23 we must speak by the card,24 or equivocation will undo us, [To Horatio, R.] How long hast thou been a grave-maker?)
(5202%&%1st Clo. Of all the days i'the year, I came to't that day that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.)
(5206%&%1st Clo. Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: It was the very day that young Hamlet was born,25 he that is mad, and sent into England.)
(5226%&%1st Clo. Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty years.)
(5228%&%Ham. How long will a man lie i'the earth ere he rot?)
(5242%&%1st Clo. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! he poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.)
(5259%&%[Gives the skull to Horatio, who returns it to the grave-digger.])
(5291%&%Enter Priests, &c., in procession; the corpse of Ophelia, Laertes and Mourners following; King, Queen, their Trains, &c.)
(5385%&%Laer. (L., leaping from the grave.) The devil take thy soul!)
(5404%&%Ham. (R.C.) Why, I will fight with him upon this theme)
(5510%&%Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit.50 Your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.)
(5514%&%Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.)
(5518%&%Ham. But yet, methinks it is very sultry and hot,51 for my complexion,—)
(5534%&%Osr. Sir, you are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is—)
(5536%&%Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to know himself.58)
(5552%&%99Ham. The phrase would be more german62 to the matter, if we could carry cannon by our sides.)
(5554%&%Osr. The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; and it would come to immediate trial, if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.63)
(5558%&%Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.)
(5572%&%Ham. (C.) I do not think so; since he went into France, I have been in continual practice; I shall win at the odds.65 But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here about my heart: but it is no matter.)
(5576%&%Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving,66 as would, perhaps, trouble a woman.)
(5578%&%Hor. If your mind dislike any thing, obey it:67 I will forestall their repair hither, and say, you are not fit.)
(5587%&%King and Queen, on a dais, Laertes (R.), Lords (R.), Ladies (L.), Osric (R.) and Attendants, with Foils, &c., discovered (R.H.); Tables (R. and L.)—Flourish of Trumpets.)

(5828%&%[Stabs the King, who is borne away by his attendants, mortally wounded, R.H.U.E.])
