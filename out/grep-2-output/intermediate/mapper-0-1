(261%&%Enter the King and Queen, preceded by Polonius, Hamlet, Laertes23, Lords, Ladies, and Attendants.)
(311%&%Pol. (R.) He hath, my lord, (wrung from me my slow leave)
(331%&%Ham. Not so, my lord; I am too much i'the sun.32)
(483%&%Ham. Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:52)
(540%&%Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all,)
(696%&%Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,)
(922%&%Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think.)
(982%&%Ham. (L.C.) The king doth wake to-night,87 and takes his rouse,88)
(1080%&%Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,96)
(1121%&%[Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet, L.H., followed at a distance by Horatio and Marcellus.])
(1363%&%Ham. How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?)
(1378%&%Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave)
(1440%&%[Horatio and Marcellus place each their right hand on Hamlet's sword.])
(1468%&%As, Well, we know; or, We could, an if we would; or, If)
(1509%&%I.1 me:] i.e., me who am already on the watch, and have a right to demand the watch-word.)
(1521%&%I.7 To watch the minutes of this night;] This seems to have been an expression common in Shakespeare's time.)
(1523%&%I.8 Approve our eyes,] To approve, in Shakespeare's age, signified to make good or establish.)
(1525%&%I.9 What we have seen.] We must here supply "with," or "by relating" before "what we have seen.")
(1527%&%I.10 It harrows me with fear and wonder.] i.e., it confounds and overwhelms me.)
(1529%&%I.11 Usurp'st this time of night,] i.e., abuses, uses against right, and the order of things.)
(1541%&%I.17 Palmy state] Outspread, flourishing. Palm branches were the emblem of victory.)
(1563%&%I.22 The extravagant and erring spirit] Extravagant is, got out of his bounds. Erring is here used in the sense of wandering.)
(1565%&%I.23 Laertes is unknown in the original story, being an introduction of Shakespeare's.)
(1585%&%Catch the auspicious moment! be time thine own! and may the exercise of thy fairest virtue fill up those hours, that are wholly at your command!)
(1587%&%I.31 A little more than kin, and less than kind.] Dr. Johnson says that kind is the Teutonic word for child. Hamlet, therefore, answers to the titles of cousin and son, which the king had given him, that he was somewhat more than cousin, and less than son. Steevens remarks, that it seems to have been another proverbial phrase: "The nearer we are in blood, the further we must be from love; the greater the kindred is, the less the kindness must be." Kin is still used in the Midland Counties for cousin, and kind signifies nature. Hamlet may, therefore, mean that the relationship between them had become unnatural.)
(1589%&%I.32 I am too much i'the sun.] Meaning, probably, his being sent for from his studies to be exposed at his uncle's marriage as his chiefest courtier, and being thereby placed too much in the radiance of the king's presence; or, perhaps, an allusion to the proverb, "Out of Heaven's blessing, into the warm sun:" but it is not unlikely that a quibble is meant between son and sun.)
(1611%&%I.43 Sits smiling to my heart:] To is at: gladdens my heart.)
(1613%&%I.44 In grace whereof,] i.e., respectful regard or honour of which.)
(1615%&%I.45 No jocund health, that Denmark drinks to-day,] Dr. Johnson remarks, that the king's intemperance is very strongly impressed; everything that happens to him gives him occasion to drink. The Danes were supposed to be hard drinkers.)
(1617%&%I.46 Resolve itself] To resolve is an old word signifying to dissolve.)
(1633%&%I.54 But what make you] What is your object? What are you doing?)
(1635%&%I.55 What, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?] In Shakespeare's time there was a university at Wittenberg; but as it was not founded till 1502, it consequently did not exist in the time to which this play refers.)
(1637%&%I.56 My dearest foe] i.e., my direst or most important foe. This epithet was commonly used to denote the strongest and liveliest interest in any thing or person, for or against.)
(1651%&%I.60 With the act of fear,] i.e., by the influence or power of fear.)
(1657%&%I.63 He wore his beaver up.] That part of the helmet which may be lifted up, to take breath the more freely.)
(1671%&%I.70 Puff'd and reckless libertine.] Bloated and swollen, the effect of excess; and heedless and indifferent to consequences.)
(1673%&%I.71 Recks not his own read.] i.e., heeds not his own lessons or counsel.)
(1677%&%I.73 Look thou charácter.] i.e., a word often used by Shakespeare to signify to write, strongly infix; the accent is on the second syllable.)
(1691%&%I.80 Given private time to you;] Spent his time in private visits to you.)
(1693%&%I.81 As so 'tis put on me,] Suggested to, impressed on me.)
(1703%&%i.e., inexperienced girl. Unsifted means one who has not nicely canvassed and examined the peril of her situation.)
(1707%&%I.85 Slander any leisure moment,] i.e., I would not have you so disgrace your most idle moments, as not to find better employment for them than lord Hamlet's conversation.)
(1709%&%I.86 An eager air.] Eager here means sharp, from aigre, French.)
(1727%&%I.95 At a pin's fee;] i.e., the value of a pin.)
(1729%&%I.96 What if it tempt you toward the flood, &c.] Malignant spirits were supposed to entice their victims into places of gloom and peril, and exciting in them the deepest terror.)
(1741%&%I.102 Hair to stand on end,] A common image of that day. "Standing as frighted with erected haire.")
(1743%&%I.103 The fretful porcupine:] This animal being considered irascible and timid.)
(1747%&%I.105 Rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,] i.e., in indolence and sluggishness, by its torpid habits contributes to that morbid state of its juices which may figuratively be denominated rottenness.)
(1761%&%I.112 Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd;] To housel is to minister the sacrament to one lying on his death bed. Disappointed is the same as unappointed, which here means unprepared. Unanel'd is without extreme unction.)
(1765%&%I.114 Pale his uneffectual fire:] i.e., not seen by the light of day; or it may mean, shining without heat.)
(1767%&%I.115 In this distracted globe.] i.e., his head distracted with thought.)
(1781%&%I.122 Give it welcome.] Receive it courteously, as you would a stranger when introduced.)
(1783%&%I.123 Antick disposition] i.e., strange, foreign to my nature, a disposition which Hamlet assumes as a protection against the danger which he apprehends from his uncle, and as a cloak for the concealment of his own meditated designs.)
(1787%&%I.125 Friending to you—shall not lack] Disposition to serve you shall not be wanting.)
(1952%&%King. (C.) O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.)
(2003%&%[Reads] To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified Ophelia,—12)
(2005%&%That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase, beautified is a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:)
(2023%&%O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;15 I have not art to reckon my groans: but that I love thee best, O most best,16 believe it. Adieu.)
(2025%&%Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,17 Hamlet.)
(2090%&%Pol. Hath there been such a time (I'd fain know that,))
(2119%&%Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:)
(2160%&%Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god, kissing carrion,——Have you a daughter?27)
(2164%&%Ham. Let her not walk i'the sun: conception is a blessing; but as your daughter may conceive,—friend, look to't, look to't, look to't.)
(2168%&%Pol. (Aside.) Still harping on my daughter:—yet he knew me not at first; he said I was a fishmonger. [Crosses to L.] I'll speak to him again.—What do you read, my lord?)
(2182%&%Pol. (Aside.) Though this be madness, yet there's method in it. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?)
(2210%&%Ham. (C.) Then is dooms-day near: but your news is not true. In the beaten way of friendship,30 what make you at Elsinore?)
(2214%&%Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you. Were you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come, come, deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.)
(2218%&%Ham. Any thing—but to the purpose. You were sent for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties have not craft enough to colour: I know the good king and queen have sent for you.)
(2241%&%Ham. Why did you laugh, then, when I said, Man delights not me?)
(2243%&%Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten entertainment38 the players shall receive from you: we coted them on the way;39 and hither are they coming, to offer you service.)
(2245%&%Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome, his majesty shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall end his part in peace;40 and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't.41—What players are they?)
(2247%&%Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the tragedians of the city.)
(2249%&%Ham. How chances it, they travel?42 their residence, both in reputation and profit, was better both ways. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city? Are they so followed?)
(2263%&%Ham. I am but mad north-north west: when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a hern-shaw.46)
(2269%&%Ham. (Crosses C.) Hark you, Guildenstern;—and Rosencrantz: that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling-clouts.)
(2289%&%Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastorical-comical, historical-pastoral, scene indivisible, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light.49 For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men.50)
(2313%&%Ham. Why, As by lot, God wot,51 and then, you know, It came to pass, As most like it was,—The first row of the pious Chanson52 will show you more; for look, my abridgment comes.53)
(2315%&%Enter Four or Five Players (L.H.)—Polonius crosses behind Hamlet to R.H.)
(2317%&%You are welcome, masters; welcome, all: O, old friend! 44Why, thy face is valanced54 since I saw thee last; Com'st thou to beard me55 in Denmark?—What, my young lady and mistress. By-'r-lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine.56 You are welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers,57 fly at anything we see: We'll have a speech straight: Come, give us a taste of your quality;58 come, a passionate speech.)
(2395%&%Pol. Look, whether he has not turned his colour, and has tears in's eyes.—Prithee, no more.)
(2397%&%Ham. (C.) 'Tis well; I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.—Good, my lord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time: After your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.)
(2399%&%Pol. (R.) My lord, I will use them according to their desert.)
(2401%&%Ham. Much better: Use every man after his desert, and who shall 'scape whipping? Use them after your own honour and dignity: The less they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty. Take them in.)
(2421%&%Ham. Very well.—Follow that lord; and look you mock him not.)
(2478%&%Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i'the throat,)
(2553%&%II.1 Polonius,] Doctor Johnson describes Polonius as "a man bred in courts, exercised in business, stored with observation, confident in his knowledge, proud of his eloquence, and declining into dotage. A man positive and confident, because he knows his mind was once strong, and knows not that it is become weak." The idea of dotage encroaching upon wisdom will solve all the phenomena of the character of Polonius.)
(2557%&%II.3 Ecstacy of love;] i.e., madness of love. In this sense the word is now obsolete.)
(2575%&%II.8 In the full bent,] To the full stretch and range—a term derived from archery.)
(2577%&%II.9 The trail of policy] The trail is the course of an animal pursued by the scent.)
(2579%&%II.10 Expostulate] To expostulate is to discuss, to put the pros and cons, to answer demands upon the question. Expose is an old term of similar import.)
(2593%&%II.17 Whilst this machine is to him,] Belongs to, obey his impulse; so long as he is "a sensible warm motion," the similar expression to "While my wits are my own.")
(2599%&%II.20 If I had played the desk, or table book;] This line may either mean if I had conveyed intelligence between them, or, known of their love, if I had locked up his secret in my own breast, as closely as it were confined in a desk or table book.)
(2601%&%II.21 Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb;] i.e., connived at it.)
(2607%&%II.24 Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;] She took the fruits of advice when she obeyed advice, the advice was then made fruitful.—Johnson.)
(2621%&%II.31 Rights of our fellowship and constancy of our youth,] Habits of familiar intercourse and correspondent years.)
(2623%&%II.32 A better proposer] An advocate of more address in shaping his aims, who could make a stronger appeal.)
(2627%&%II.34 Nay, then, I have an eye of you.] i.e., I have a glimpse of your meaning. Hamlet's penetration having shown him that his two friends are set over him as spies.)
(2629%&%II.35 So shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather.] Be beforehand with your discovery, and the plume and gloss of your secret pledge be in no feather shed or tarnished.)
(2641%&%II.41 The lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't.] i.e., the lady shall mar the measure of the verse, rather than not express herself freely and fully.)
(2645%&%II.43 It is not very strange; for my uncle is king of Denmark;] This is a reflection on the mutability of fortune, and the variableness of man's mind.)
(2647%&%II.44 Make mouths at him] i.e., deride him by antic gestures and mockery.)
(2661%&%II.51 As by lot, God wot,] There was an old ballad entitled the song of Jephthah, from which these lines are probably quotations. The story of Jephthah was also one of the favourite subjects of ancient tapestry.)
(2663%&%II.52 The first row of the pious Chanson] This expression does not appear to be very well understood. Steevens tells us that the pious chansons were a kind of Christmas carols, containing some scriptural history thrown into loose rhymes, and sung about the streets. The first row appears to mean the first division of one of these.)
(2665%&%II.53 My abridgment comes.] Hamlet alludes to the players, whose approach will shorten his talk.)
(2667%&%II.54 Thy face is valanced] i.e., fringed with a beard. The valance is the fringes or drapery hanging round the tester of a bed.)
(2669%&%II.55 Com'st thou to beard me] To beard anciently meant to set at defiance. Hamlet having just told the player that his face is valanced, is playing upon the word beard.)
(2681%&%II.61 Falls with the whiff and wind of his fell sword] Our author employs the same image in almost the same phrase:)
(2711%&%II.73 I'll tent him to the quick:] i.e., probe him—search his wounds.)
(2733%&%Guild. (R.) Nor do we find him forward1 to be sounded)
(2764%&%King. With all my heart; and it doth much content me)
(2957%&%Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.25)
(2959%&%Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?)
(2973%&%Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.)
(2977%&%Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry. Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a nunnery; farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; go; go.)
(3004%&%To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!)
