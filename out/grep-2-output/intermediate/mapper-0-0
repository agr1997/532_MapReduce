(189%&%[Horatio crosses in front of the Ghost to R. Ghost crosses to L.])
(325%&%Ham. (L.) A little more than kin, and less than kind.31)
(329%&%13King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?)
(419%&%[Trumpet March repeated. Exeunt King and Queen, preceded by Polonius, Lords, Ladies, Laertes, and Attendants, R.H.])

(712%&%And bid me hold my peace. [Crosses to L.] I pray you all,)
(828%&%Look thou charácter.73 Give thy thoughts no tongue, any unproportion'd thought74 his act.)
(936%&%Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.)
(974%&%Hor. (R.C.) Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season,)
(1117%&%By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me:—99)
(1126%&%Ham. (R.) Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak; I'll go no further.)
(1195%&%Ham. Haste me to know it, that I, with wings as swift)
(1515%&%I.4 The rivals of my watch,] Rivals, for partners or associates.)
(1517%&%I.5 And liegemen to the Dane.] i.e., owing allegiance to Denmark.)
(1531%&%I.12 I might not this believe, &c.] I could not: it had not been permitted me, &c., without the full and perfect evidence, &c.)
(1533%&%I.13 Jump at this dead hour,] Jump and just were synonymous in Shakespeare's time.)
(1535%&%I.14 In what particular thought to work,] In what particular course to set my thoughts at work: in what particular train to direct the mind and exercise it in conjecture.)
(1537%&%I.15 Gross and scope] Upon the whole, and in a general view.)
(1539%&%I.16 Bodes some strange eruption to our state,] i.e., some political distemper, which will break out in dangerous consequences.)
(1551%&%So in Decker's Knight's Conjuring, &c. "If any of them had bound the spirit of gold by any charmes in cares, or in iron fetters, under the ground, they should, for their own soule's quiet (which, questionless, else would whine up and down,) not for the good of their children, release it.")
(1559%&%Apparitions were supposed to fly from the crowing of the cock, because it indicated the approach of day.)
(1571%&%I.26 With a defeated joy,] i.e., with joy baffled; with joy interrupted by grief.)
(1575%&%I.28 Your leave and favour] The favour of your leave granted, the kind permission. Two substantives with a copulative being here, as is the frequent practice of our author, used for an adjective and substantive: an adjective sense is given to a substantive.)
(1577%&%I.29 Upon his will I sealed my hard consent:] At or upon his earnest and importunate suit, I gave my full and final, though hardly obtained and reluctant, consent.)
(1599%&%I.37 That father lost, lost his;] "That lost father (of your father, i.e., your grandfather), or father so lost, lost his.")
(1601%&%I.38 Do obsequious sorrow:] Follow with becoming and ceremonious observance the memory of the deceased.)
(1603%&%I.39 But to perséver] This word was anciently accented on the second syllable.)
(1621%&%I.48 The uses of this world!] i.e., the habitudes and usages of life.)
(1625%&%I.50 Hyperion to a satyr:] An allusion to the exquisite beauty of Apollo, compared with the deformity of a satyr; that satyr, perhaps, being Pan, the brother of Apollo. Our great poet is here guilty of a false quantity, by calling Hypĕrīon, Hypērĭon, a mistake not unusual among our English poets.)
(1629%&%I.52 I'll change that name with you.] i.e., do not call yourself my servant, you are my friend; so I shall call you, and so I would have you call me.)
(1647%&%i.e., suppress your astonishment for a short time, that you may be the better able to give your attention to what we will relate.)

(1715%&%I.89 Questionable shape,] To question, in our author's time, signified to converse. Questionable, therefore, means capable of being conversed with.)
(1719%&%I.91 Cerements;] Those precautions usually adopted in preparing dead bodies for sepulture.)
(1731%&%I.97 Beetles o'er his base into the sea,] i.e., projects darkly over the sea.)
(1733%&%I.98 Némean lion's nerve.] Shakespeare, and nearly all the poets of his time, disregarded the quantity of Latin names. The poet has here placed the accent on the first syllable, instead of the second.)
(1735%&%I.99 That lets me:] To let, in the sense in which it is here used, means to hinder—to obstruct—to oppose. The word is derived from the Saxon.)
(1737%&%I.100 To fast in fires,] Chaucer has a similar passage with regard to eternal punishment—"And moreover the misery of Hell shall be in default of meat and drink.")
(1757%&%I.110 Hebenon] Hebenon is described by Nares in his Glossary, as the juice of ebony, supposed to be a deadly poison.)
(1771%&%I.117 Come, bird, come.] This is the call which falconers used to their hawk in the air when they would have him come down to them.)
(1773%&%I.118 There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark— But he's an arrant knave.] Hamlet probably begins these words in the ardour of confidence and sincerity; but suddenly alarmed at the magnitude of the disclosure he was going to make, and considering that, not his friend Horatio only, but another person was present, he breaks off suddenly:—"There's ne'er a villain in all Denmark that can match (perhaps he would have said) my uncle in villainy; but recollecting the danger of such a declaration, he pauses for a moment, and then abruptly concludes:—"but he's an arrant knave.")
(1775%&%I.119 Whirling words,] Random words thrown out with no specific aim.)
(1777%&%I.120 By Saint Patrick,] At this time all the whole northern world had their learning from Ireland; to which place it had retired, and there flourished under the auspices of this Saint.)
(1797%&%Oph. O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!)
(1821%&%Oph. He took me by the wrist, and held me hard;)
(1850%&%Pol. Come, go with me; I will go seek the king.)
(1944%&%Pol. Now do I think (or else this brain of mine)
(2044%&%Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,)
(2156%&%Ham. Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten thousand.)
(2178%&%Ham. Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue28 says here that old men have grey beards; that their faces are 39wrinkled; their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams: All of which, sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down; for yourself, sir, shall be as old as I am, if, like a crab, you could go backward.)
(2187%&%Pol. (L.) Indeed, that is out o' the air.—How pregnant sometimes his replies29 are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter.—My honourable lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.)
(2189%&%Ham. (C.) You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will more willingly part withall, except my life, except my life, except my life.)
(2196%&%Pol. (Without.) You go to seek the lord Hamlet; there he is.)
(2206%&%Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? [Crosses to Rosencrantz.] Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both? What news?)
(2208%&%Ros. (L.) None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.)
(2222%&%Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights of our fellowship, [taking their hands,] by the consonancy of our youth,31 by the obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer32 could charge you withal, be even33 and direct with me, whether you were sent for, or no?)
(2237%&%Ham. (Returning C.) I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather.35 I have of late (but wherefore I know not) lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and, indeed, it goes so heavily with my disposition, that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a steril promontory; this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this 41majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason! how infinite in faculties! in form and moving how express36 and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world! the paragon37 of animals! And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not me,—nor woman neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.)
(2239%&%Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.)
(2253%&%42Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is king of Denmark,43 and those that would make mouths at him44 while my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.45 There is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out.)
(2259%&%Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands. You are welcome: but my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.)
(2271%&%Ros. (R.) Haply he's the second time come to them; for they say an old man is twice a child.)
(2273%&%Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players; mark it.—You say right, sir: o'Monday morning; 'twas then, indeed.)
(2279%&%Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in Rome,——)
(2307%&%Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I love passing well.)
(2321%&%Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once,—but it was never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas caviare to the general:59 but it was an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning.60 One speech in it I chiefly loved; 'twas Æneas' tale to Dido; and thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of Priam's slaughter: If it live in your memory, begin at this line; let me see, let me see;—)
(2323%&%The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,—'tis not so: it begins with Pyrrhus:)
(2332%&%Pol. (R.) 'Fore Heaven, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion.)
(2374%&%Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.— Say on;—come to Hecuba.)
(2376%&%1st Play. But who, ah woe, had seen the mobled queen—)
(2411%&%Old friend [Crosses to C.] —My good friends [To Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.] I'll leave you till night: you are welcome to Elsinore—can you play the murder of Gonzago?)
(2417%&%Ham. We'll have it to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which I would insert in't—could you not?)
(2565%&%i.e., this must be made known to the king, for (being kept secret) the hiding Hamlet's love might occasion more mischief to us from him and the queen, than the uttering or revealing of it will occasion hate and resentment from Hamlet.)
(2567%&%It was the custom of Shakespeare's age, to conclude acts and scenes with a couplet, a custom which was continued for nearly a century afterwards.)
(2569%&%II.5 The understanding of himself,] i.e., the just estimate of himself.)
(2583%&%II.12 Most beautified Ophelia,] Heywood, in his History of Edward VI., says "Katharine Parre, Queen Dowager to King Henry VIII., was a woman beautified with many excellent virtues." The same expression is frequently used by other old authors.)
(2585%&%II.13 In her excellent white bosom,] The ladies, in Shakespeare's time, wore pockets in the front of their stays.)
(2587%&%II.14 These, &c.] In our poet's time, the word these was usually added at the end of the superscription of letters.)
(2589%&%II.15 I am ill at these numbers;] No talent for these rhymes.)
(2611%&%II.26 You are a fishmonger.] This was an expression better understood in Shakespeare's time than at present, and no doubt was relished by the audience of the Globe Theatre as applicable to the Papists, who in Queen Elizabeth's time were esteemed enemies to the Government. Hence the proverbial phrase of He's an honest man and eats no fish; to signify he's a friend to the Government and a Protestant.)
(2613%&%II.27 For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god, kissing carrion,——Have you a daughter?] i.e., Hamlet having just remarked that honesty is very rare in the world, adds, that since there is so little virtue, since corruption abounds everywhere, and maggots are bred by the sun, which is a god, even in a dead dog, Polonius ought to take care to prevent his daughter from walking in the sun, lest she should prove "a breeder of sinners;" for though conception (understanding) in general be a blessing, yet as Ophelia might chance to conceive (to be pregnant), it might be a calamity. Hamlet's abrupt question, "Have you a daughter?" is evidently intended to impress Polonius with the belief of the Prince's madness.—Malone.)
(2615%&%II.28 The satirical rogue] Hamlet alludes to Juvenal, who in his 10th Satire, describes the evils of long life.)
(2619%&%II.30 Beaten way of friendship,] Plain track, open and unceremonious course.)
(2635%&%II.38 Lenten entertainment] i.e., sparing, like the entertainments given in Lent.)
(2637%&%II.39 We coted them on the way;] To cote, is to pass by, to pass the side of another. It appears to be a word of French origin, and was a common sporting term in Shakespeare's time.)
(2639%&%II.40 The humorous man shall end his part in peace;] The fretful or capricious man shall vent the whole of his spleen undisturbed.)
(2651%&%II.46 I know a hawk from a hern-shaw.] A hernshaw is a heron or hern. To know a hawk from a hernshaw is an ancient proverb, sometimes corrupted into handsaw. Spencer quotes the proverb, as meaning, wise enough to know the hawk from its game.)
(2653%&%II.47 Buz, buz!] Sir William Blackstone states that buz used to be an interjection at Oxford when any one began a story that was generally known before.)
(2655%&%II.48 Then came each actor on his ass.] This seems to be a line of a ballad.)
(2657%&%II.49 Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light.] An English translation of the tragedies of Seneca was published in 1581, and one comedy of Plautus, viz., the Menœchme, in 1595.)
(2659%&%II.50 For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men.] The probable meaning of this passage is,—For the observance of the rules of the Drama, while they take such liberties, as are allowable, they are the only men—writ is an old word for writing.)
(2671%&%II.56 By the altitude of a chopine.] A chioppine is a high shoe, or rather clog, worn by the Italians. Venice was more famous for them than any other place. They are described as having been made of wood covered with coloured leather, and sometimes even half a yard high, their altitude being proportioned to the rank of the lady, so that they could not walk without being supported.)
(2673%&%II.57 Like French falconers,] The French seem to have been the first and noblest falconers in the western part of Europe. The French king sent over his falconers to show that sport to King James the First. —See Weldon's Court of King James.)
(2677%&%II.59 Caviare to the general;] Caviare is the spawn of fish pickled, salted, and dried. It is imported from Russia, and was considered in the time of Shakespeare a new and fashionable luxury, not obtained or relished by the vulgar, and therefore used by him to signify anything above their comprehension—general is here used for the people.)
(2679%&%II.60 As much modesty as cunning.] As much propriety and decorum as skill.)
(2695%&%II.65 His whole functions suiting with forms to his conceit?] i.e., his powers and faculties—the whole energies of his soul and body giving material forms to his passion, such as tone of voice, expression of face, requisite action, in accordance with the ideas that floated in his conceit or imagination.)
(2699%&%II.67 Like John a-dreams,] Or dreaming John, a name apparently coined to suit a dreaming, stupid person; he seems to have been a well-known character.)
(2701%&%II.68 Unpregnant of my cause,] i.e., not quickened with a new desire of vengeance; not teeming with revenge.)
(2705%&%II.70 Lack gall to make oppression bitter;] i.e., lack gall to make me feel the bitterness of oppression.)
(2723%&%Enter King and Queen, preceded by Polonius. Ophelia, Rosencrantz, and Giuldenstern, following (R.H.))
(2846%&%Ham. To be, or not to be, that is the question:8)
(2912%&%And lose the name of action.22 [—Ophelia returns.—] Soft you now!23)
(2961%&%Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd, than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness:26 this was some time a paradox, but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.)
(2965%&%Ham. You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock, but we shall relish of it:27 I loved you not.)
(2969%&%Ham. Get thee to a nunnery: Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest; but yet I could accuse me of such things, that it were better my mother had not borne me: I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my beck28 than I have thoughts to put them in,29 imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I do, crawling between earth and heaven? 54We are arrant knaves, all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your father?)
(2981%&%Ham. I have heard of your paintings30 too, well enough; Heaven hath given you one face, and you make yourselves another:31 you jig, you amble, and you lisp,32 and nickname Heaven's creatures, and make your wantonness your ignorance.33 Go to, I'll no more of't; it hath made me mad. [Hamlet crosses to R.H.] I say, we will have no more marriages: those that are married already, all but one,34 shall live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery, go.)
(3061%&%Ham. (C.) Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it, as many of our players do, I had as lief42 the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hands thus;43 but use all gently: for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say) whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul, to hear a robustious perrywig-pated fellow44 tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings,45 who, for the most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise: I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant;46 it out-herods Herod:47 Pray you, avoid it.)
