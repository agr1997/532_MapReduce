0 HAMLET,
1 PRINCE OF DENMARK.
2 ACT I.
3 Scene I.—ELSINORE. A Platform before the Castle. Night.
4 Francisco on his post. Enter to him Bernardo, L.H.
5 
6 Ber. Who's there?
7 
8 Fran. (R.) Nay, answer me:1 stand, and unfold2 yourself.
9 
10 Ber. Long live the king!3
11 
12 Fran.
13 Bernardo?
14 
15 Ber.
16 He.
17 
18 Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
19 
20 Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
21 
22 Fran. For this relief much thanks: [Crosses to L.] 'tis bitter cold,
23 
24 And I am sick at heart.
25 
26 Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
27 
28 Fran.
29 Not a mouse stirring.
30 
31 Ber. Well, good night.
32 
33 If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
34 
35 The rivals of my watch,4 bid them make haste.
36 
37 Fran. I think I hear them.—Stand, ho! Who's there?
38 
39 8
40 Hor. Friends to this ground.
41 
42 Mar.
43 And liegemen to the Dane.5
44 
45 Enter Horatio and Marcellus L.H.
46 
47 Fran. Give you good night.
48 
49 Mar.
50 O, farewell, honest soldier:
51 
52 Who hath reliev'd you?
53 
54 Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
55 
56 Give you good night.
57 
58 [Exit Francisco, L.H.]
59 
60 Mar.
61 Holloa! Bernardo!
62 
63 Ber.
64 Say,
65 
66 What, is Horatio there?
67 
68 Hor. (Crosses to C.) A piece of him.6
69 
70 Ber. (R.) Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
71 
72 Hor. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
73 
74 Ber. I have seen nothing.
75 
76 Mar. (L.) Horatio says, 'tis but our fantasy,
77 
78 And will not let belief take hold of him,
79 
80 Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
81 
82 Therefore I have entreated him, along
83 
84 With us, to watch the minutes of this night;7
85 
86 That, if again this apparition come,
87 
88 He may approve our eyes,8 and speak to it.
89 
90 Hor. Tush! tush! 'twill not appear.
91 
92 Ber. Come, let us once again assail your ears,
93 
94 That are so fortified against our story,
95 
96 What we two nights have seen.9
97 
98 Hor. Well, let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
99 
100 Ber. Last night of all,
101 
102 When yon same star that's westward from the pole
103 
104 Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
105 
106 Where now it burns, Marcellus, and myself,
107 
108 The bell then beating one—
109 
110 9Mar. Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
111 
112 Enter Ghost L.H.
113 
114 Ber. In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
115 
116 Hor. Most like:—it harrows me with fear and wonder.10
117 
118 Ber. It would be spoke to.
119 
120 Mar. Speak to it, Horatio.
121 
122 Hor. What art thou, that usurp'st this time of night,11
123 
124 Together with that fair and warlike form
125 
126 In which the majesty of buried Denmark
127 
128 Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee, speak!
129 
130 Mar. It is offended.
131 
132 [Ghost crosses to R.]
133 
134 Ber.
135 See! it stalks away!
136 
137 Hor. Stay!—speak!—speak, I charge thee, speak!
138 
139 [Exit Ghost, R.H.]
140 
141 Mar. 'Tis gone, and will not answer.
142 
143 Ber. How now, Horatio! You tremble, and look pale:
144 
145 Is not this something more than fantasy?
146 
147 What think you of it?
148 
149 Hor. Before heaven, I might not this believe,
150 
151 Without the sensible and true avouch12
152 
153 Of mine own eyes.
154 
155 Mar.
156 Is it not like the king?
157 
158 Hor. As thou art to thyself:
159 
160 Such was the very armour he had on,
161 
162 When he the ambitious Norway combated.
163 
164 Mar. Thus, twice before, and jump at this dead hour,13
165 
166 With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
167 
168 Hor. In what particular thought to work,14 I know not;
169 
170 10
171 But in the gross and scope15 of mine opinion,
172 
173 This bodes some strange eruption to our state.16
174 
175 In the most high and palmy17 state of Rome,
176 
177 A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
178 
179 The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
180 
181 Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets.
182 
183 Re-enter Ghost R.H.
184 
185 But, (L.C.) soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
186 
187 I'll cross it, though it blast me.
188 
189 [Horatio crosses in front of the Ghost to R. Ghost crosses to L.]
190 
191 Stay, illusion!
192 
193 If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,18
194 
195 Speak to me:
196 
197 If there be any good thing to be done,
198 
199 That may to thee do ease, and grace to me,
200 
201 Speak to me:
202 
203 If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
204 
205 Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid,
206 
207 O, speak!
208 
209 O, if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
210 
211 Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,19
212 
213 For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
214 
215 Speak of it:—stay, and speak!
216 
217 [Exit Ghost, L.H.]
218 
219 Mar. 'Tis gone!
220 
221 We do it wrong, being so majestical,
222 
223 To offer it the show of violence.
224 
225 Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
226 
227 Hor. And then it started like a guilty thing
228 
229 11
230 Upon a fearful summons.20 I have heard,
231 
232 The cock, that is the trumpet of the morn,
233 
234 Doth with his lofty21 and shrill-sounding throat
235 
236 Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
237 
238 Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
239 
240 The extravagant and erring spirit22 hies
241 
242 To his confine.
243 
244 But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
245 
246 Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastern hill:
247 
248 Break we our watch up; and, by my advice,
249 
250 Let us impart what we have seen to-night
251 
252 Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
253 
254 This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
255 
256 [Exeunt, L.H.]
257 
258 Scene II.—A ROOM OF STATE IN THE PALACE.
259 Trumpet March.
260 
261 Enter the King and Queen, preceded by Polonius, Hamlet, Laertes23, Lords, Ladies, and Attendants.
262 
263 King. R.C. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
264 
265 The memory be green;24 and that it us befitted
266 
267 To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
268 
269 To be contracted in one brow of woe;
270 
271 Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature,
272 
273 That we with wisest sorrow25 think on him,
274 
275 Together with remembrance of ourselves.
276 
277 Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
278 
279 The imperial jointress of this warlike state,
280 
281 12
282 Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,26
283 
284 Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd27
285 
286 Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
287 
288 With this affair along:—For all, our thanks.
289 
290 And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
291 
292 You told us of some suit; What is't, Laertes?
293 
294 Laer. (R.)
295 My dread lord,
296 
297 Your leave and favour28 to return to France;
298 
299 From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
300 
301 To show my duty in your coronation,
302 
303 Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
304 
305 My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France,
306 
307 And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
308 
309 King. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonious?
310 
311 Pol. (R.) He hath, my lord, (wrung from me my slow leave
312 
313 By laboursome petition; and, at last,
314 
315 Upon his will I sealed my hard consent):29
316 
317 I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
318 
319 King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
320 
321 And thy best graces spend it at thy will!30
322 
323 But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,——
324 
325 Ham. (L.) A little more than kin, and less than kind.31
326 
327 [Aside.]
328 
329 13King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
330 
331 Ham. Not so, my lord; I am too much i'the sun.32
332 
333 Queen. (L.C.) Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour33 off,
334 
335 And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
336 
337 Do not for ever with thy vailed lids34
338 
339 Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
340 
341 Thou know'st 'tis common, all that live must die,
342 
343 Passing through nature to eternity.
344 
345 Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
346 
347 Queen.
348 If it be,
349 
350 Why seems it so particular with thee?
351 
352 Ham. Seems, madam! nay, it is; I know not seems.
353 
354 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
355 
356 Nor the dejected haviour of the visage,
357 
358 No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
359 
360 Together with all forms, modes, shows of grief,
361 
362 That can denote me truly: These, indeed, seem,
363 
364 For they are actions that a man might play.
365 
366 But I have that within which passeth show;35
367 
368 These but the trappings36 and the suits of woe.
369 
370 King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
371 
372 To give these mourning duties to your father:
373 
374 But, you must know, your father lost a father;
375 
376 That father lost, lost his;37 and the survivor bound,
377 
378 In filial obligation, for some term
379 
380 14
381 To do obsequious sorrow:38 But to perséver39
382 
383 In obstinate condolement,40 is a course
384 
385 Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief:
386 
387 It shows a will most incorrect to Heaven.41
388 
389 We pray you, throw to earth
390 
391 This unprevailing42 woe; and think of us
392 
393 As of a father: for let the world take note,
394 
395 You are the most immediate to our throne;
396 
397 Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
398 
399 Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
400 
401 I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
402 
403 Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
404 
405 King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply;
406 
407 Be as ourself in Denmark.—Madam, come;
408 
409 This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
410 
411 Sits smiling to my heart:43 in grace whereof,44
412 
413 No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,45
414 
415 But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell;
416 
417 Re-speaking earthly thunder.
418 
419 [Trumpet March repeated. Exeunt King and Queen, preceded by Polonius, Lords, Ladies, Laertes, and Attendants, R.H.]
420 
421 Ham. O, that this too, too solid flesh would melt,
422 
423 Thaw, and resolve itself46 into a dew!
424 
425 Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
426 
427 His canon47 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! O God!
428 
429 How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
430 
431 15
432 Seem to me all the uses of this world!48
433 
434 Fye on't! O fye! 'tis an unweeded garden,
435 
436 That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
437 
438 Possess it merely.49 That it should come to this!
439 
440 But two months dead!—nay, not so much, not two:
441 
442 So excellent a king; that was, to this,
443 
444 Hyperion to a satyr:50 so loving to my mother,
445 
446 That he might not beteem51 the winds of heaven
447 
448 Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
449 
450 Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
451 
452 As if increase of appetite had grown
453 
454 By what it fed on: And yet, within a month,—
455 
456 Let me not think on't,—Frailty, thy name is Woman!—
457 
458 A little month; or ere those shoes were old
459 
460 With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
461 
462 Like Niobe, all tears;—she married with my uncle,
463 
464 My father's brother; but no more like my father
465 
466 Than I to Hercules.
467 
468 It is not, nor it cannot come to, good:
469 
470 But break, my heart, for I must hold my tongue!
471 
472 Enter Horatio, Bernardo, and Marcellus R.H.
473 
474 Hor. Hail to your lordship!
475 
476 Ham.
477 I am glad to see you well:
478 
479 Horatio,—or I do forget myself.
480 
481 Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
482 
483 Ham. Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:52
484 
485 And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?—
486 
487 Marcellus?
488 
489 [Crosses to C.]
490 
491 Mar. (R.) My good lord,—
492 
493 16Ham. (C.) I am very glad to see you; good even, sir.
494 
495 [To Bernardo, R.]
496 
497 But what, in faith,53 make you54 from Wittenberg?55
498 
499 Hor. (L.) A truant disposition, good my lord.
500 
501 Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so;
502 
503 Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
504 
505 To make it truster of your own report
506 
507 Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
508 
509 But what is your affair in Elsinore?
510 
511 We'll teach you to drink deep, ere you depart.
512 
513 Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
514 
515 Ham. I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
516 
517 I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
518 
519 Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
520 
521 Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral bak'd meats
522 
523 Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
524 
525 Would I had met my dearest foe56 in Heaven
526 
527 Ere ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
528 
529 My father,—Methinks, I see my father.
530 
531 Hor.
532 Where,
533 
534 My lord?
535 
536 Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
537 
538 Hor. I saw him once; he was a goodly king.57
539 
540 Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all,
541 
542 I shall not look upon his like again.
543 
544 [Crosses to L.]
545 
546 Hor. (C.) My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
547 
548 Ham. Saw who?
549 
550 Hor. My lord, the king your father.
551 
552 Ham.
553 The king my father!
554 
555 Hor. Season your admiration for a while58
556 
557 17
558 With an attent ear; till I may deliver,
559 
560 Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
561 
562 This marvel to you.
563 
564 Ham.
565 For Heaven's love, let me hear.
566 
567 Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen,
568 
569 Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
570 
571 In the dead waste and middle of the night,59
572 
573 Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
574 
575 Arm'd at all points exactly, cap-à-pé,
576 
577 Appears before them, and, with solemn march
578 
579 Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
580 
581 By their oppress'd and fear-surprisèd eyes,
582 
583 Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distill'd
584 
585 Almost to jelly with the act of fear,60
586 
587 Stand dumb, and speak not to him. This to me
588 
589 In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
590 
591 And I with them the third night kept the watch:
592 
593 Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
594 
595 Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
596 
597 The apparition comes.
598 
599 Ham. But where was this?
600 
601 [Crosses to Marcellus.]
602 
603 Mar. (R.) My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
604 
605 Ham. (C.) Did you not speak to it?
606 
607 Hor. (L.)
608 My lord, I did;
609 
610 But answer made it none: yet once methought
611 
612 It lifted up its head, and did address61
613 
614 Itself to motion, like as it would speak:
615 
616 But, even then, the morning cock crew loud,
617 
618 And at the sound it shrunk in haste away;
619 
620 And vanish'd from our sight.
621 
622 Ham.
623 'Tis very strange.
624 
625 Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
626 
627 And we did think it writ down62 in our duty
628 
629 To let you know of it.
630 
631 18Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
632 
633 Hold you the watch to-night?
634 
635 Mar.
636 We do, my lord.
637 
638 Ham. Arm'd, say you?
639 
640 Mar.
641 Arm'd, my lord.
642 
643 Ham.
644 From top to toe?
645 
646 Mar. My lord, from head to foot.
647 
648 Ham.
649 Then saw you not
650 
651 His face?
652 
653 Hor.
654 O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.63
655 
656 Ham. What, looked he frowningly?
657 
658 Hor.
659 A countenance more
660 
661 In sorrow than in anger.
662 
663 Ham.
664 Pale or red?
665 
666 Hor. Nay, very pale.
667 
668 Ham.
669 And fix'd his eyes upon you?
670 
671 Hor. Most constantly.
672 
673 Ham.
674 I would I had been there.
675 
676 Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
677 
678 Ham.
679 Very like,
680 
681 Very like. Stay'd it long?
682 
683 Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
684 
685 Mar.
686 
687 Ber.
688 
689 Longer, Longer.
690 
691 Hor. Not when I saw it.
692 
693 Ham.
694 His beard was grizzl'd, No?
695 
696 Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
697 
698 A sable silver'd.
699 
700 Ham.
701 I will watch to-night;
702 
703 Perchance, 'twill walk again.
704 
705 Hor. (C.)
706 I warrant it will.
707 
708 Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
709 
710 I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape,
711 
712 And bid me hold my peace. [Crosses to L.] I pray you all,
713 
714 If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
715 
716 Let it be tenable64 in your silence still;
717 
718 And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
719 
720 19
721 Give it an understanding, but no tongue;
722 
723 I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
724 
725 Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
726 
727 I'll visit you.
728 
729 Hor. (R.)
730 Our duty to your honour.
731 
732 Ham. Your loves, as mine to you: Farewell.
733 
734 [Exeunt Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo, R.H.]
735 
736 My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
737 
738 I doubt some foul play: 'would the night were come;
739 
740 Till then sit still, my soul: Foul deeds will rise,
741 
742 Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
743 
744 [Exit, L.H.]
745 
746 Scene III.—A ROOM IN POLONIUS'S HOUSE.
747 Enter Laertes and Ophelia (R.H.)
748 
749 Laer. (L.C.) My necessaries are embarked: farewell:
750 
751 And, sister, as the winds give benefit,65
752 
753 Let me hear from you.
754 
755 Oph. (R.C.)
756 Do you doubt that?
757 
758 Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,66
759 
760 Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
761 
762 A violet in the youth of primy nature,
763 
764 Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
765 
766 The pérfume and suppliance of a minute.67
767 
768 Oph. No more but so?
769 
770 Laer. He may not, as unvalued persons do,
771 
772 Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
773 
774 The safety and the health of the whole state.
775 
776 Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
777 
778 If with too credent ear you list his songs.
779 
780 Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister;
781 
782 20
783 And keep within the rear of your affection,68
784 
785 Out of the shot and danger of desire.
786 
787 The chariest maid69 is prodigal enough,
788 
789 If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
790 
791 Virtue itself scapes not calumnious strokes:
792 
793 Be wary, then; best safety lies in fear:
794 
795 Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
796 
797 Oph. I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
798 
799 As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
800 
801 Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
802 
803 Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven
804 
805 Whilst, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,70
806 
807 Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
808 
809 And recks not his own read.71
810 
811 Laer.
812 O, fear me not.
813 
814 I stay too long;—but here my father comes.
815 
816 Enter Polonius (L.H.)
817 
818 Pol. Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
819 
820 The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,72
821 
822 And you are staid for. There,—my blessing with you!
823 
824 [Laying his hand on Laertes' head.]
825 
826 And these few precepts in thy memory—
827 
828 Look thou charácter.73 Give thy thoughts no tongue, any unproportion'd thought74 his act.
829 
830 Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
831 
832 The friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
833 
834 Grapple them to thy soul with hooks of steel;
835 
836 But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
837 
838 Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
839 
840 Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
841 
842 21
843 Bear it, that the opposer may beware of thee.
844 
845 Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice:
846 
847 Take each man's censure,75 but reserve thy judgment.
848 
849 Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
850 
851 But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy:
852 
853 For the apparel oft proclaims the man;
854 
855 And they in France of the best rank and station
856 
857 Are most select and generous, chief in that.76
858 
859 Neither a borrower nor a lender be:
860 
861 For loan oft loses both itself and friend;
862 
863 And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.77
864 
865 This above all,—To thine ownself be true;
866 
867 And it must follow, as the night the day,
868 
869 Thou canst not then be false to any man.
870 
871 Farewell; my blessing season this in thee!78
872 
873 Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
874 
875 [Crosses to L.]
876 
877 Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
878 
879 What I have said to you.
880 
881 Oph. (Crosses to Laertes.) 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
882 
883 And you yourself shall keep the key of it.79
884 
885 Laer. Farewell.
886 
887 [Exit Laertes, L.H.]
888 
889 Pol. What is it, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
890 
891 Oph. So please you, something touching the lord Hamlet.
892 
893 Pol. Marry, well bethought:
894 
895 'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
896 
897 Given private time to you;80 and you yourself
898 
899 Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
900 
901 If it be so (as so 'tis put on me,81
902 
903 And that in way of caution), I must tell you,
904 
905 You do not understand yourself so clearly
906 
907 As it behoves my daughter, and your honour.
908 
909 22
910 What is between82 you? give me up the truth.
911 
912 Oph. He hath, my lord, of late, made many tenders
913 
914 Of his affection to me.
915 
916 Pol. Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
917 
918 Unsifted83 in such perilous circumstance.
919 
920 Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
921 
922 Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
923 
924 Pol. Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
925 
926 That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
927 
928 Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
929 
930 Or, you'll tender me a fool.
931 
932 Oph. My lord, he hath impórtun'd me with love
933 
934 In honourable fashion.
935 
936 Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
937 
938 Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
939 
940 With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
941 
942 Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks.84 I do know,
943 
944 When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
945 
946 Lends the tongue vows: This is for all,—
947 
948 I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
949 
950 Have you so slander any leisure moment,85
951 
952 As to give words or talk with the lord Hamlet.
953 
954 Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.
955 
956 Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
957 
958 [Exeunt, R.H.]
959 
960 Scene IV.—THE PLATFORM. Night.
961 Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus (L.H.U.E.)
962 
963 Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
964 
965 Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.86
966 
967 23Ham. What hour now?
968 
969 Hor.
970 I think it lacks of twelve.
971 
972 Mar. No, it is struck.
973 
974 Hor. (R.C.) Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season,
975 
976 Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
977 
978 [A Flourish of Trumpets, and Ordnance shot off without.]
979 
980 What does this mean, my lord?
981 
982 Ham. (L.C.) The king doth wake to-night,87 and takes his rouse,88
983 
984 And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
985 
986 The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
987 
988 The triumph of his pledge.
989 
990 Hor.
991 Is it a custom?
992 
993 Ham. Ay, marry, is't: [Crosses to Horatio.]
994 
995 But to my mind,—though I am native here,
996 
997 And to the manner born,—it is a custom
998 
999 More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
1000 
1001 Enter Ghost (L.H.)
1002 
1003 Hor. (R.H.) Look, my lord, it comes!
1004 
1005 Ham. (C.) Angels and ministers of grace defend us!—
1006 
1007 Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
1008 
1009 Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
1010 
1011 Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
1012 
1013 Thou com'st in such a questionable shape,89
1014 
1015 That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee—Hamlet,
1016 
1017 King, father: Royal Dane: O, answer me!
1018 
1019 Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
1020 
1021 Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,90
1022 
1023 Have burst their cerements;91 why the sepulchre,
1024 
1025 Wherein we saw thee quietly in-urn'd,
1026 
1027 Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws,
1028 
1029 24
1030 To cast thee up again! What may this mean,
1031 
1032 That thou, dead corse, again, in cómplete steel,
1033 
1034 Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
1035 
1036 Making night hideous; and we fools of nature92
1037 
1038 So horridly to shake our disposition93
1039 
1040 With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
1041 
1042 Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?
1043 
1044 [Ghost beckons.]
1045 
1046 Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
1047 
1048 As if it some impartment did desire
1049 
1050 To you alone.
1051 
1052 [Ghost beckons again.]
1053 
1054 Mar. Look, with what courteous action
1055 
1056 It waves you to a more removèd ground:94
1057 
1058 But do not go with it.
1059 
1060 Hor.
1061 No, by no means.
1062 
1063 Ham. It will not speak; then I will follow it.
1064 
1065 Hor. Do not, my lord.
1066 
1067 Ham.
1068 Why, what should be the fear?
1069 
1070 I do not set my life at a pin's fee;95
1071 
1072 And for my soul, what can it do to that,
1073 
1074 Being a thing immortal as itself?
1075 
1076 [Ghost beckons.]
1077 
1078 It waves me forth again;—I'll follow it.
1079 
1080 Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,96
1081 
1082 Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
1083 
1084 That beetles o'er his base into the sea,97
1085 
1086 And there assume some other horrible form,
1087 
1088 And draw you into madness?
1089 
1090 [Ghost beckons.]
1091 
1092 Ham.
1093 It waves me still.—
1094 
1095 Go on; I'll follow thee.
1096 
1097 Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
1098 Ham.
1099 Hold off your hands.
1100 
1101 Hor. Be rul'd; you shall not go.
1102 
1103 Ham.
1104 My fate cries out,
1105 
1106 25
1107 And makes each petty artery in this body
1108 
1109 As hardy as the Némean lion's nerve.98
1110 
1111 [Ghost beckons]
1112 
1113 Still am I call'd:—unhand me, gentlemen;
1114 
1115 [Breaking from them.]
1116 
1117 By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me:—99
1118 
1119 I say, away!—Go on; I'll follow thee.
1120 
1121 [Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet, L.H., followed at a distance by Horatio and Marcellus.]
1122 
1123 Scene V.—A MORE REMOTE PART OF THE PLATFORM. Night.
1124 Re-enter Ghost and Hamlet (L.H.U.E.)
1125 
1126 Ham. (R.) Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak; I'll go no further.
1127 
1128 Ghost. (L.) Mark me.
1129 
1130 Ham.
1131 I will.
1132 
1133 Ghost.
1134 My hour is almost come,
1135 
1136 When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
1137 
1138 Must render up myself.
1139 
1140 Ham.
1141 Alas, poor ghost!
1142 
1143 Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
1144 
1145 To what I shall unfold.
1146 
1147 Ham.
1148 Speak; I am bound to hear.
1149 
1150 Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
1151 
1152 Ham. What?
1153 
1154 Ghost. I am thy father's spirit;
1155 
1156 Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
1157 
1158 And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,100
1159 
1160 Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
1161 
1162 26
1163 Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
1164 
1165 To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
1166 
1167 I could a tale unfold, whose lightest word
1168 
1169 Would harrow up thy soul;101 freeze thy young blood;
1170 
1171 Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres;
1172 
1173 Thy knotted and combinèd locks to part,
1174 
1175 And each particular hair to stand on end,102
1176 
1177 Like quills upon the fretful porcupine:103
1178 
1179 But this eternal blazon104 must not be
1180 
1181 To ears of flesh and blood.—List, list, O, list!—
1182 
1183 If thou didst ever thy dear father love,——
1184 
1185 Ham. O Heaven!
1186 
1187 Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
1188 
1189 Ham. Murder!
1190 
1191 Ghost. Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
1192 
1193 But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
1194 
1195 Ham. Haste me to know it, that I, with wings as swift
1196 
1197 As meditation or the thoughts of love,
1198 
1199 May sweep to my revenge.
1200 
1201 Ghost.
1202 I find thee apt;
1203 
1204 And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
1205 
1206 That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,105
1207 
1208 Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
1209 
1210 'Tis given out that, sleeping in mine orchard,106
1211 
1212 A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
1213 
1214 Is by a forged process107 of my death
1215 
1216 Rankly abus'd: but know, thou noble youth,
1217 
1218 The serpent that did sting thy father's life
1219 
1220 Now wears his crown.
1221 
1222 Ham. O, my prophetic soul! my uncle!
1223 
1224 Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
1225 
1226 27
1227 With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,
1228 
1229 Won to his shameful lust
1230 
1231 The will of my most seeming virtuous queen:
1232 
1233 O, Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
1234 
1235 From me, whose love was of that dignity,
1236 
1237 That it went hand in hand even with the vow
1238 
1239 I made to her in marriage; and to decline
1240 
1241 Upon a wretch,108 whose natural gifts were poor
1242 
1243 To those of mine!
1244 
1245 But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
1246 
1247 Brief let me be.—Sleeping within mine orchard,
1248 
1249 My custom always in the afternoon,
1250 
1251 Upon my secure109 hour thy uncle stole,
1252 
1253 With juice of cursed hebenon110 in a vial,
1254 
1255 And in the porches of mine ears did pour
1256 
1257 The leperous distilment; whose effect
1258 
1259 Holds such an enmity with blood of man,
1260 
1261 That, swift as quicksilver, it courses through
1262 
1263 The natural gates and alleys of the body;
1264 
1265 So did it mine;
1266 
1267 Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
1268 
1269 Of life, of crown, of queen, at once despatch'd:111
1270 
1271 Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
1272 
1273 Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd;112
1274 
1275 No reckoning made, but sent to my account
1276 
1277 With all my imperfections on my head.
1278 
1279 Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
1280 
1281 Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
1282 
1283 Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
1284 
1285 A couch for luxury113 and damnèd incest.
1286 
1287 But, howsoever thou pursu'st this act,
1288 
1289 Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
1290 
1291 28
1292 Against thy mother aught: leave her to Heaven,
1293 
1294 And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
1295 
1296 To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
1297 
1298 The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
1299 
1300 And 'gins to pale his ineffectual fire:114
1301 
1302 Adieu, adieu, adieu! remember me.
1303 
1304 [Exit, L.H.]
1305 
1306 Ham. Hold, hold, my heart;
1307 
1308 And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
1309 
1310 But bear me stiffly up.—Remember thee!
1311 
1312 Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
1313 
1314 In this distracted globe.115 Remember thee!
1315 
1316 Yea, from the table of my memory
1317 
1318 I'll wipe away all forms, all pressures past,116
1319 
1320 And thy commandment all alone shall live
1321 
1322 Within the book and volume of my brain,
1323 
1324 Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven,
1325 
1326 I have sworn't.
1327 
1328 Hor. (Without.) My lord, my lord,——
1329 
1330 Mar. (Without.) Lord Hamlet,——
1331 
1332 Hor. (Without.) Heaven secure him!
1333 
1334 Ham.
1335 So be it!
1336 
1337 Mar. (Without.) Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
1338 
1339 Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.117
1340 
1341 Enter Horatio and Marcellus (L.H.U.E.)
1342 
1343 Mar. (R.) How is't, my noble lord?
1344 
1345 Hor. (L.)
1346 What news, my lord?
1347 
1348 Ham. (C.) O, wonderful!
1349 
1350 Hor.
1351 Good my lord, tell it.
1352 
1353 Ham.
1354 No;
1355 
1356 You will reveal it.
1357 
1358 Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven.
1359 
1360 Mar.
1361 Nor I, my lord.
1362 
1363 Ham. How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
1364 
1365 But you'll be secret?—
1366 
1367 29
1368 Hor.
1369 
1370 Mar.
1371 
1372 Ay, by heaven, my lord.
1373 
1374 Ham. There's ne'er a villain, dwelling in all Denmark—
1375 
1376 But he's an arrant knave.118
1377 
1378 Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
1379 
1380 To tell us this.
1381 
1382 Ham. Why, right; you are in the right;
1383 
1384 And so, without more circumstance at all,
1385 
1386 I hold it fit that we shake hands, and part:
1387 
1388 You as your business and desire shall point you,
1389 
1390 For every man hath business and desire,
1391 
1392 Such as it is;—and, for my own poor part,
1393 
1394 Look you, I will go pray.
1395 
1396 Hor. These are but wild and whirling words,119 my lord.
1397 
1398 Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily.
1399 
1400 Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
1401 
1402 Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick,120 but there is, Horatio,
1403 
1404 And much offence, too. Touching this vision here,
1405 
1406 It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
1407 
1408 For your desire to know what is between us,
1409 
1410 O'er-master it121 as you may. And now, good friends,
1411 
1412 As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
1413 
1414 Give me one poor request.
1415 
1416 Hor.
1417 What is't, my lord?
1418 
1419 We will.
1420 
1421 Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
1422 
1423 30
1424 Hor.
1425 
1426 Mar.
1427 
1428 My lord, we will not.
1429 
1430 Ham.
1431 Nay, but swear't.
1432 
1433 Hor.
1434 Propose the oath, my lord.
1435 
1436 Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
1437 
1438 Swear by my sword.
1439 
1440 [Horatio and Marcellus place each their right hand on Hamlet's sword.]
1441 
1442 Ghost. (Beneath.) Swear.
1443 
1444 Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
1445 
1446 Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.122
1447 
1448 There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
1449 
1450 Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
1451 
1452 But come;—
1453 
1454 Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
1455 
1456 How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,
1457 
1458 As I, perchance, hereafter shall think meet
1459 
1460 To put an antick disposition123 on,—
1461 
1462 That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
1463 
1464 With arms encumber'd thus,124 or this head-shake,
1465 
1466 Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
1467 
1468 As, Well, we know; or, We could, an if we would; or, If
1469 
1470 we list to speak;—or, There be, an if they might;—
1471 
1472 Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
1473 
1474 That you know aught of me:—This do you swear,
1475 
1476 So grace and mercy at your most need help you!
1477 
1478 [Horatio and Marcellus again place their hands on Hamlet's sword.]
1479 
1480 Ghost. (Beneath.) Swear.
1481 
1482 Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So gentlemen,
1483 
1484 With all my love I do commend me to you:
1485 
1486 And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
1487 
1488 May do, to express his love and friending to you,
1489 
1490 31
1491 Heaven willing, shall not lack.125 Let us go in together;
1492 
1493 [Crosses to L.]
1494 
1495 And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
1496 
1497 The time is out of joint;—O cursèd spite,
1498 
1499 That ever I was born to set it right!
1500 
1501 Nay, come, let's go together.
1502 
1503 [Exeunt L.H.]
1504 
1505 END OF ACT FIRST.
1506 Notes
1507 Act I
1508

1510

1518 
1519 I.6 A piece of him.] Probably a cant expression.
1520 
1521 I.7 To watch the minutes of this night;] This seems to have been an expression common in Shakespeare's time.
1522 
1523 I.8 Approve our eyes,] To approve, in Shakespeare's age, signified to make good or establish.
1524 
1525 I.9 What we have seen.] We must here supply "with," or "by relating" before "what we have seen."
1526 
1527 I.10 It harrows me with fear and wonder.] i.e., it confounds and overwhelms me.
1528 
1529 I.11 Usurp'st this time of night,] i.e., abuses, uses against right, and the order of things.

1532 
1533 I.13 Jump at this dead hour,] Jump and just were synonymous in Shakespeare's time.
1534

1536 
1537 I.15 Gross and scope] Upon the whole, and in a general view.
1538 
1539 I.16 Bodes some strange eruption to our state,] i.e., some political distemper, which will break out in dangerous consequences.
1540 
1541 I.17 Palmy state] Outspread, flourishing. Palm branches were the emblem of victory.
1542 
1543 I.18 Sound, or use of voice,] Articulation.
1544 
1545 I.19
1546 
1547 Uphoarded in thy life
1548 
1549 Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,]
1550 
1551 So in Decker's Knight's Conjuring, &c. "If any of them had bound the spirit of gold by any charmes in cares, or in iron fetters, under the ground, they should, for their own soule's quiet (which, questionless, else would whine up and down,) not for the good of their children, release it."
1552 
1553 I.20
1554 
1555 And then it started like a guilty thing
1556 
1557 Upon a fearful summons.]
1558 
1559 Apparitions were supposed to fly from the crowing of the cock, because it indicated the approach of day.
1560 
1561 I.21 Lofty] High and loud.
1562 
1563 I.22 The extravagant and erring spirit] Extravagant is, got out of his bounds. Erring is here used in the sense of wandering.
1564 
1565 I.23 Laertes is unknown in the original story, being an introduction of Shakespeare's.
1566 
1567 I.24 Green;] Fresh.
1568 
1569 I.25 Wisest sorrow] Sober grief, passion discreetly reined.
1570 
1571 I.26 With a defeated joy,] i.e., with joy baffled; with joy interrupted by grief.
1572 
1573 I.27 Barr'd] Excluded—acted without the concurrence of.
1574 
1575 I.28 Your leave and favour] The favour of your leave granted, the kind permission. Two substantives with a copulative being here, as is the frequent practice of our author, used for an adjective and substantive: an adjective sense is given to a substantive.
1576 
1577 I.29 Upon his will I sealed my hard consent:] At or upon his earnest and importunate suit, I gave my full and final, though hardly obtained and reluctant, consent.
1578 
1579 I.30
1580 
1581 Take thy fair hour! time be thine;
1582 
1583 And thy best graces spend it at thy will!]
1584 
1585 Catch the auspicious moment! be time thine own! and may the exercise of thy fairest virtue fill up those hours, that are wholly at your command!
1586 
1587 I.31 A little more than kin, and less than kind.] Dr. Johnson says that kind is the Teutonic word for child. Hamlet, therefore, answers to the titles of cousin and son, which the king had given him, that he was somewhat more than cousin, and less than son. Steevens remarks, that it seems to have been another proverbial phrase: "The nearer we are in blood, the further we must be from love; the greater the kindred is, the less the kindness must be." Kin is still used in the Midland Counties for cousin, and kind signifies nature. Hamlet may, therefore, mean that the relationship between them had become unnatural.
1588 
1589 I.32 I am too much i'the sun.] Meaning, probably, his being sent for from his studies to be exposed at his uncle's marriage as his chiefest courtier, and being thereby placed too much in the radiance of the king's presence; or, perhaps, an allusion to the proverb, "Out of Heaven's blessing, into the warm sun:" but it is not unlikely that a quibble is meant between son and sun.
1590 
1591 I.33 Nighted colour] Black—night-like.
1592 
1593 I.34 Vailed lids] Cast down.
1594 
1595 I.35 Which passeth show;] i.e., "external manners of lament."
1596 
1597 I.36 Trappings] Trappings are "furnishings."
1598 
1599 I.37 That father lost, lost his;] "That lost father (of your father, i.e., your grandfather), or father so lost, lost his."
1600 
1601 I.38 Do obsequious sorrow:] Follow with becoming and ceremonious observance the memory of the deceased.
1602 
1603 I.39 But to perséver] This word was anciently accented on the second syllable.
1604 
1605 I.40 Obstinate condolement,] Ceaseless and unremitted expression of grief.
1606 
1607 I.41 Incorrect to Heaven.] Contumacious towards Heaven.

1610 
1611 I.43 Sits smiling to my heart:] To is at: gladdens my heart.
1612 
1613 I.44 In grace whereof,] i.e., respectful regard or honour of which.
1614 
1615 I.45 No jocund health, that Denmark drinks to-day,] Dr. Johnson remarks, that the king's intemperance is very strongly impressed; everything that happens to him gives him occasion to drink. The Danes were supposed to be hard drinkers.
1616 
1617 I.46 Resolve itself] To resolve is an old word signifying to dissolve.
1618 
1619 I.47 His canon] i.e., his rule or law.

1623 I.49 Merely.] Wholly—entirely.
1624 
1625 I.50 Hyperion to a satyr:] An allusion to the exquisite beauty of Apollo, compared with the deformity of a satyr; that satyr, perhaps, being Pan, the brother of Apollo. Our great poet is here guilty of a false quantity, by calling Hypĕrīon, Hypērĭon, a mistake not unusual among our English poets.
1626 
1627 I.51 Might not beteem] i.e., might not allow, permit.
1628 
1629 I.52 I'll change that name with you.] i.e., do not call yourself my servant, you are my friend; so I shall call you, and so I would have you call me.
1630 
1631 I.53 In faith.] Faithfully, in pure and simple verity.

1634 
1635 I.55 What, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?] In Shakespeare's time there was a university at Wittenberg; but as it was not founded till 1502, it consequently did not exist in the time to which this play refers.

1650 
1651 I.60 With the act of fear,] i.e., by the influence or power of fear.
1652 
1653 I.61 Address] i.e., make ready.
1654

1732 
1733 I.98 Némean lion's nerve.] Shakespeare, and nearly all the poets of his time, disregarded the quantity of Latin names. The poet has here placed the accent on the first syllable, instead of the second.
1734 
1735 I.99 That lets me:] To let, in the sense in which it is here used, means to hinder—to obstruct—to oppose. The word is derived from the Saxon.

1773 I.118 There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark— But he's an arrant knave.] Hamlet probably begins these words in the ardour of confidence and sincerity; but suddenly alarmed at the magnitude of the disclosure he was going to make, and considering that, not his friend Horatio only, but another person was present, he breaks off suddenly:—"There's ne'er a villain in all Denmark that can match (perhaps he would have said) my uncle in villainy; but recollecting the danger of such a declaration, he pauses for a moment, and then abruptly concludes:—"but he's an arrant knave."
1774

1791 ACT II.
1792 Scene I.—A ROOM IN POLONIUS'S HOUSE.
1793 Enter Polonius1 (L.H.), meeting Ophelia. (R.H.)
1794 
1795 Pol. How now, Ophelia! What's the matter?
1796 
1797 Oph. O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
1798 
1799 Pol. With what, in the name of Heaven?
1800 
1801 Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
1802 
1803 Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd;
1804 
1805 Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other,
1806 
1807 And with a look so piteous in purport,
1808 
1809 He comes before me.
1810 
1811 Pol. Mad for thy love?
1812 
1813 Oph.
1814 My lord, I do not know;
1815 
1816 But, truly, I do fear it.
1817 
1818 Pol.
1819 What said he?
1820 
1821 Oph. He took me by the wrist, and held me hard;
1822 
1823 Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
1824 
1825 And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
1826 
1827 He falls to such perusal of my face
1828 
1829 As he would draw it. Long staid he so;
1830 
1831 At last,—a little shaking of mine arm,
1832 
1833 And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
1834 
1835 He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound,
1836 
1837 As it did seem to shatter all his bulk,2
1838 
1839 And end his being: That done, he lets me go:
1840 
1841 And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
1842 
1843 33
1844 He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
1845 
1846 For out o'doors he went without their helps,
1847 
1848 And, to the last, bended their light on me.
1849 
1850 Pol. Come, go with me; I will go seek the king.
1851 
1852 This is the very ecstacy of love;3
1853 
1854 What, have you given him any hard words of late?
1855 
1856 Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
1857 
1858 I did repel his letters, and denied
1859 
1860 His access to me.
1861 
1862 Pol.
1863 That hath made him mad.
1864 
1865 Come, go we to the king:
1866 
1867 This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
1868 
1869 More grief to hide than hate to utter love.4
1870 
1871 Come.
1872 
1873 [Exeunt L.H.]
1874 
1875 Scene II.—A ROOM IN THE CASTLE.
1876 Enter King, Queen, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and Attendants (R.H.)
1877 
1878 King. (C.) Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
1879 
1880 Moreover that we much did long to see you,
1881 
1882 The need we have to use you did provoke
1883 
1884 Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
1885 
1886 Of Hamlet's transformation. What it should be,
1887 
1888 More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
1889 
1890 So much from the understanding of himself,5
1891 
1892 34I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,
1893 
1894 That you vouchsafe your rest6 here in our court
1895 
1896 Some little time: so by your companies
1897 
1898 To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
1899 
1900 Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
1901 
1902 That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
1903 
1904 Queen. (R.C.) Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;
1905 
1906 And sure I am two men there are not living
1907 
1908 To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
1909 
1910 So to expend your time with us a while,
1911 
1912 Your visitation shall receive such thanks
1913 
1914 As fits a king's remembrance.
1915 
1916 Ros. (R.)
1917 Both your majesties
1918 
1919 Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,7
1920 
1921 Put your dread pleasures more into command
1922 
1923 Than to entreaty.
1924 
1925 Guil. (R.)
1926 But we both obey,
1927 
1928 And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,8
1929 
1930 To lay our service freely at your feet.
1931 
1932 King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
1933 
1934 Queen. I do beseech you instantly to visit
1935 
1936 My too much changèd son. Go, some of you,
1937 
1938 And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
1939 
1940 [Exeunt Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and Attendants, R.H.]
1941 
1942 Enter Polonius (L.H.)
1943 
1944 Pol. Now do I think (or else this brain of mine
1945 
1946 Hunts not the trail of policy9 so sure
1947 
1948 As it hath us'd to do), that I have found
1949 
1950 The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
1951 
1952 King. (C.) O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.
1953 
1954 Pol. (L.C.) My liege, and madam, to expostulate10
1955 
1956 35
1957 What majesty should be, what duty is,
1958 
1959 Why day is day, night night, and time is time,
1960 
1961 Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time;
1962 
1963 Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
1964 
1965 And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,—
1966 
1967 I will be brief:—Your noble son is mad:
1968 
1969 Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
1970 
1971 What is't, but to be nothing else but mad?
1972 
1973 But let that go.
1974 
1975 Queen. (R.C.) More matter, with less art.
1976 
1977 Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
1978 
1979 That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
1980 
1981 And pity 'tis, 'tis true: a foolish figure;
1982 
1983 But farewell it, for I will use no art.
1984 
1985 Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains
1986 
1987 That we find out the cause of this effect,
1988 
1989 Or, rather say, the cause of this defect,
1990 
1991 For this effect defective comes by cause:
1992 
1993 Thus it remains, and the remainder thus,
1994 
1995 Perpend.11
1996 
1997 I have a daughter, have, while she is mine,
1998 
1999 Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
2000 
2001 Hath given me this: Now gather, and surmise.
2002 
2003 [Reads] To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified Ophelia,—12
2004 
2005 That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase, beautified is a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:
2006 
2007 In her excellent white bosom,13 these, &c.14
2008 
2009 Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
2010 
2011 Pol. Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.—
2012 
2013 [Reads.]
2014 Doubt thou the stars are fire;
2015 
2016 Doubt thou the sun doth move;
2017 
2018 36
2019 Doubt truth to be a liar;
2020 
2021 But never doubt, I love.
2022 
2023 O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;15 I have not art to reckon my groans: but that I love thee best, O most best,16 believe it. Adieu.
2024 
2025 Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,17 Hamlet.
2026 
2027 This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me:
2028 
2029 And more above,18 hath his solicitings,19
2030 
2031 As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
2032 
2033 All given to my ear.
2034 
2035 King.
2036 But how hath she
2037 
2038 Receiv'd his love?
2039 
2040 Pol. What do you think of me?
2041 
2042 King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
2043 
2044 Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
2045 
2046 When I had seen this hot love on the wing
2047 
2048 (As I perceived it, I must tell you that,
2049 
2050 Before my daughter told me), what might you,
2051 
2052 Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
2053 
2054 If I had play'd the desk or table book;20
2055 
2056 Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb;21
2057 
2058 Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;22
2059 
2060 What might you think? No, I went round to work,23
2061 
2062 And my young mistress thus did I bespeak:
2063 
2064 Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy sphere;
2065 
2066 This must not be: and then I precepts gave her,
2067 
2068 37
2069 That she should lock herself from his resort,
2070 
2071 Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
2072 
2073 Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;24
2074 
2075 And he, repuls'd (a short tale to make),
2076 
2077 Fell into sadness; thence into a weakness;
2078 
2079 Thence to a lightness; and, by this declension,
2080 
2081 Into the madness wherein now he raves,
2082 
2083 And all we mourn for.
2084 
2085 King.
2086 Do you think 'tis this?
2087 
2088 Queen. It may be, very likely.
2089 
2090 Pol. Hath there been such a time (I'd fain know that,)
2091 
2092 That I have positively said, 'tis so,
2093 
2094 When it proved otherwise?
2095 
2096 King.
2097 Not that I know.
2098 
2099 Pol. Take this from this, if it be otherwise:
2100 
2101 [Pointing to his head and shoulder.]
2102 
2103 If circumstances lead me, I will find
2104 
2105 Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
2106 
2107 Within the centre.
2108 
2109 King.
2110 How may we try it further?
2111 
2112 Pol. You know, sometimes he walks for hours together
2113 
2114 Here in the lobby.
2115 
2116 Queen.
2117 So he does, indeed.
2118 
2119 Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
2120 
2121 Mark the encounter: if he love her not,
2122 
2123 And be not from his reason fallen thereon,
2124 
2125 Let me be no assistant for a state,
2126 
2127 But keep a farm, and carters.
2128 
2129 King.
2130 We will try it.
2131 
2132 Queen. But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
2133 
2134 Pol. Away, I do beseech you both, away:
2135 
2136 I'll board him presently.25
2137 
2138 [Exeunt King and Queen, R.H.]
2139 
2140 Enter Hamlet, reading (L.C.)
2141 
2142 Pol. How does my good lord Hamlet?
2143 
2144 38Ham. (C.) Excellent well.
2145 
2146 Pol. (R.) Do you know me, my lord?
2147 
2148 Ham. Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.26
2149 
2150 Pol. Not I, my lord.
2151 
2152 Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.
2153 
2154 Pol. Honest, my lord!
2155 
2156 Ham. Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten thousand.
2157 
2158 Pol. That's very true, my lord.
2159 
2160 Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god, kissing carrion,——Have you a daughter?27
2161 
2162 Pol. I have, my lord.
2163 
2164 Ham. Let her not walk i'the sun: conception is a blessing; but as your daughter may conceive,—friend, look to't, look to't, look to't.
2165 
2166 [Goes up stage.]
2167 
2168 Pol. (Aside.) Still harping on my daughter:—yet he knew me not at first; he said I was a fishmonger. [Crosses to L.] I'll speak to him again.—What do you read, my lord?
2169 
2170 Ham. (C.) Words, words, words.
2171 
2172 Pol. (L.) What is the matter, my lord?
2173 
2174 Ham. Between who?
2175 
2176 Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
2177 
2178 Ham. Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue28 says here that old men have grey beards; that their faces are 39wrinkled; their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams: All of which, sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down; for yourself, sir, shall be as old as I am, if, like a crab, you could go backward.
2179 
2180 [Crosses, L.]
2181 
2182 Pol. (Aside.) Though this be madness, yet there's method in it. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
2183 
2184 Ham. Into my grave?
2185 [Crosses R.]
2186 
2187 Pol. (L.) Indeed, that is out o' the air.—How pregnant sometimes his replies29 are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter.—My honourable lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.
2188 
2189 Ham. (C.) You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will more willingly part withall, except my life, except my life, except my life.
2190 
2191 Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
2192 [Exit Polonius, L.H.]
2193 
2194 Ham. These tedious old fools!
2195 
2196 Pol. (Without.) You go to seek the lord Hamlet; there he is.
2197 
2198 Ros. Heaven save you, sir!
2199 
2200 Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (L.H.)
2201 
2202 Guil. My honor'd lord!—
2203 
2204 Ros. My most dear lord!—
2205 
2206 Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? [Crosses to Rosencrantz.] Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both? What news?
2207 
2208 Ros. (L.) None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
2209 
2210 Ham. (C.) Then is dooms-day near: but your news is not true. In the beaten way of friendship,30 what make you at Elsinore?
2211 
2212 40Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
2213 
2214 Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you. Were you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come, come, deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.
2215 
2216 Guil. (R.) What should we say, my lord?
2217 
2218 Ham. Any thing—but to the purpose. You were sent for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties have not craft enough to colour: I know the good king and queen have sent for you.
2219 
2220 Ros. To what end, my lord?
2221 
2222 Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights of our fellowship, [taking their hands,] by the consonancy of our youth,31 by the obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer32 could charge you withal, be even33 and direct with me, whether you were sent for, or no?
2223 
2224 Ros. What say you?
2225 [To Guildenstern.]
2226 
2227 Ham. Nay, then, I have an eye of you.34
2228 
2229 [Crosses R.]
2230 
2231 [Aside.]
2232 
2233 —if you love me, hold not off.
2234 
2235 Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
2236 
2237 Ham. (Returning C.) I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather.35 I have of late (but wherefore I know not) lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and, indeed, it goes so heavily with my disposition, that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a steril promontory; this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this 41majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason! how infinite in faculties! in form and moving how express36 and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world! the paragon37 of animals! And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not me,—nor woman neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
2238 
2239 Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
2240 
2241 Ham. Why did you laugh, then, when I said, Man delights not me?
2242 
2243 Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten entertainment38 the players shall receive from you: we coted them on the way;39 and hither are they coming, to offer you service.
2244 
2245 Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome, his majesty shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall end his part in peace;40 and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't.41—What players are they?
2246 
2247 Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the tragedians of the city.
2248 
2249 Ham. How chances it, they travel?42 their residence, both in reputation and profit, was better both ways. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city? Are they so followed?
2250 
2251 Ros. No, indeed, they are not.
2252 
2253 42Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is king of Denmark,43 and those that would make mouths at him44 while my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.45 There is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out.
2254 
2255 [Flourish of trumpets without.]
2256 
2257 Guil. There are the players.
2258 
2259 Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands. You are welcome: but my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.
2260 
2261 Guil. In what, my dear lord?
2262 
2263 Ham. I am but mad north-north west: when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a hern-shaw.46
2264 
2265 [Crosses R.]
2266 
2267 Pol. (Without, L.H.) Well be with you, gentlemen!
2268 
2269 Ham. (Crosses C.) Hark you, Guildenstern;—and Rosencrantz: that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling-clouts.
2270 
2271 Ros. (R.) Haply he's the second time come to them; for they say an old man is twice a child.
2272 
2273 Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players; mark it.—You say right, sir: o'Monday morning; 'twas then, indeed.
2274 
2275 Enter Polonius L.H.
2276 
2277 Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.
2278 
2279 Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in Rome,——
2280 
2281 Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
2282 
2283 Ham. Buz, buz!47
2284 
2285 Pol. Upon my honour,——
2286 
2287 43Ham. Then came each actor on his ass.48
2288 
2289 Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastorical-comical, historical-pastoral, scene indivisible, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light.49 For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men.50
2290 
2291 Ham. O, Jephthah, judge of Israel,—what a treasure hadst thou!
2292 
2293 Pol. What a treasure had he, my lord?
2294 
2295 Ham. Why,—
2296 
2297 One fair daughter, and no more,
2298 
2299 The which he loved passing well.
2300 
2301 Pol. Still harping on my daughter.
2302 
2303 [Aside.]
2304 
2305 Ham. Am I not i'the right, old Jephthah?
2306 
2307 Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I love passing well.
2308 
2309 Ham. Nay, that follows not.
2310 
2311 Pol. What follows, then, my lord?
2312 
2313 Ham. Why, As by lot, God wot,51 and then, you know, It came to pass, As most like it was,—The first row of the pious Chanson52 will show you more; for look, my abridgment comes.53
2314 
2315 Enter Four or Five Players (L.H.)—Polonius crosses behind Hamlet to R.H.
2316 
2317 You are welcome, masters; welcome, all: O, old friend! 44Why, thy face is valanced54 since I saw thee last; Com'st thou to beard me55 in Denmark?—What, my young lady and mistress. By-'r-lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine.56 You are welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers,57 fly at anything we see: We'll have a speech straight: Come, give us a taste of your quality;58 come, a passionate speech.
2318 
2319 1st Play. (L.H.) What speech, my lord?
2320 
2321 Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once,—but it was never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas caviare to the general:59 but it was an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning.60 One speech in it I chiefly loved; 'twas Æneas' tale to Dido; and thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of Priam's slaughter: If it live in your memory, begin at this line; let me see, let me see;—
2322 
2323 The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,—'tis not so: it begins with Pyrrhus:
2324 
2325 The rugged Pyrrhus,—he, whose sable arms,
2326 
2327 45
2328 Black as his purpose, did the night resemble,
2329 
2330 Old grandsire Priam seeks.
2331 
2332 Pol. (R.) 'Fore Heaven, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion.
2333 
2334 Ham. (C.) So proceed you.
2335 
2336 1st Play. (L.) Anon he finds him
2337 
2338 Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,
2339 
2340 Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
2341 
2342 Repugnant to command: Unequal match'd,
2343 
2344 Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
2345 
2346 But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword61
2347 
2348 The unnerved father falls.
2349 
2350 But, as we often see, against some storm,
2351 
2352 A silence in the heavens, the rack62 stand still,
2353 
2354 The bold wind speechless, and the orb below
2355 
2356 As hush as death; anon the dreadful thunder
2357 
2358 Doth rend the region; So, after Pyrrhus' pause,
2359 
2360 A roused vengeance sets him new a work;
2361 
2362 And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
2363 
2364 On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
2365 
2366 With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
2367 
2368 Now falls on Priam.—
2369 
2370 Out, out, thou fickle Fortune!
2371 
2372 Pol. (R.) This is too long.
2373 
2374 Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.— Say on;—come to Hecuba.
2375 
2376 1st Play. But who, ah woe, had seen the mobled queen—
2377 
2378 Ham. The mobled queen?63
2379 
2380 Pol. That's good; mobled queen is good.
2381 
2382 1st Play. Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames;
2383 
2384 A clout upon that head
2385 
2386 Where late the diadem stood; and, for a robe,
2387 
2388 A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;
2389 
2390 46
2391 Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,
2392 
2393 'Gainst fortune's state would treason have pronounced.
2394 
2395 Pol. Look, whether he has not turned his colour, and has tears in's eyes.—Prithee, no more.
2396 
2397 Ham. (C.) 'Tis well; I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.—Good, my lord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time: After your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
2398 
2399 Pol. (R.) My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
2400 
2401 Ham. Much better: Use every man after his desert, and who shall 'scape whipping? Use them after your own honour and dignity: The less they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty. Take them in.
2402 
2403 [Crosses to R.H.]
2404 
2405 Pol. Come, sirs.
2406 
2407 Ham. Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.
2408 
2409 [Exit Polonius with some of the Players, L.H.]
2410 
2411 Old friend [Crosses to C.] —My good friends [To Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.] I'll leave you till night: you are welcome to Elsinore—can you play the murder of Gonzago?
2412 
2413 [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, R.H.]
2414 
2415 1st Play. Ay, my lord.
2416 
2417 Ham. We'll have it to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which I would insert in't—could you not?
2418 
2419 1st Play. Ay, my lord.
2420 
2421 Ham. Very well.—Follow that lord; and look you mock him not.
2422 
2423 [Exit Player, L.H.]
2424 
2425 Now I am alone.
2426 
2427 O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
2428 
2429 Is it not monstrous, that this player here,
2430 
2431 But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
2432 
2433 Could force his soul so to his own conceit,
2434 
2435 That, from her working, all his visage wann'd;64
2436 
2437 Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
2438 
2439 A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
2440 
2441 47
2442 With forms to his conceit?65 And all for nothing!
2443 
2444 For Hecuba?
2445 
2446 What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
2447 
2448 That he should weep for her? What would he do,
2449 
2450 Had he the motive and the cue66 for passion
2451 
2452 That I have? He would drown the stage with tears,
2453 
2454 And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
2455 
2456 Make mad the guilty, and appal the free;
2457 
2458 Confound the ignorant, and amaze, indeed,
2459 
2460 The very faculties of eyes and ears.
2461 
2462 Yet I,
2463 
2464 A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
2465 
2466 Like John a-dreams,67 unpregnant of my cause,68
2467 
2468 And can say nothing; no, not for a king,
2469 
2470 Upon whose property and most dear life
2471 
2472 A damn'd defeat was made.69 Am I a coward?
2473 
2474 Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
2475 
2476 Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?
2477 
2478 Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i'the throat,
2479 
2480 As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this,
2481 
2482 Ha?
2483 
2484 Why, I should take it: for it cannot be
2485 
2486 But I am pigeon-liver'd, and lack gall
2487 
2488 To make oppression bitter;70 or, ere this,
2489 
2490 I should have fatted all the region kites
2491 
2492 With this slave's offal: Bloody, bawdy villain!
2493 
2494 Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless71 villain!
2495 
2496 O, vengeance!
2497 
2498 48
2499 Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
2500 
2501 That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
2502 
2503 Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
2504 
2505 Must, like a scold, unpack my heart with words,
2506 
2507 And fall a cursing, like a very drab,
2508 
2509 A scullion!
2510 
2511 Fye upon't! fye! About, my brains!72 I have heard
2512 
2513 That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
2514 
2515 Have by the very cunning of the scene
2516 
2517 Been struck so to the soul, that presently
2518 
2519 They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
2520 
2521 For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
2522 
2523 With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players
2524 
2525 Play something like the murder of my father
2526 
2527 Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
2528 
2529 I'll tent him to the quick:73 if he do blench,74
2530 
2531 I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
2532 
2533 May be the devil: and the devil hath power
2534 
2535 To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and, perhaps
2536 
2537 Out of my weakness and my melancholy
2538 
2539 (As he is very potent with such spirits),
2540 
2541 Abuses me to damn me: I'll have good grounds
2542 
2543 More relative than this:75 The play's the thing
2544 
2545 Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.
2546

2548 
2549 END OF ACT SECOND.
2550 Notes
2551 Act II
2552 
2553 II.1 Polonius,] Doctor Johnson describes Polonius as "a man bred in courts, exercised in business, stored with observation, confident in his knowledge, proud of his eloquence, and declining into dotage. A man positive and confident, because he knows his mind was once strong, and knows not that it is become weak." The idea of dotage encroaching upon wisdom will solve all the phenomena of the character of Polonius.
2554 
2555 II.2 His bulk,] Frame.
2556 
2557 II.3 Ecstacy of love;] i.e., madness of love. In this sense the word is now obsolete.
2558 
2559 II.4
2560 
2561 This must be known; which being kept close, might move
2562 
2563 More grief to hide than hate to utter love.]
2564 
2565 i.e., this must be made known to the king, for (being kept secret) the hiding Hamlet's love might occasion more mischief to us from him and the queen, than the uttering or revealing of it will occasion hate and resentment from Hamlet.
2566 
2567 It was the custom of Shakespeare's age, to conclude acts and scenes with a couplet, a custom which was continued for nearly a century afterwards.
2568 
2569 II.5 The understanding of himself,] i.e., the just estimate of himself.
2570 
2571 II.6 Vouchsafe your rest] Please to reside.
2572 
2573 II.7 Of us,] i.e., over us.
2574 
2575 II.8 In the full bent,] To the full stretch and range—a term derived from archery.
2576 
2577 II.9 The trail of policy] The trail is the course of an animal pursued by the scent.
2578 
2579 II.10 Expostulate] To expostulate is to discuss, to put the pros and cons, to answer demands upon the question. Expose is an old term of similar import.
2580 
2581 II.11 Perpend.] i.e., reflect, consider attentively.
2582 
2583 II.12 Most beautified Ophelia,] Heywood, in his History of Edward VI., says "Katharine Parre, Queen Dowager to King Henry VIII., was a woman beautified with many excellent virtues." The same expression is frequently used by other old authors.
2584 
2585 II.13 In her excellent white bosom,] The ladies, in Shakespeare's time, wore pockets in the front of their stays.
2586 
2587 II.14 These, &c.] In our poet's time, the word these was usually added at the end of the superscription of letters.
2588 
2589 II.15 I am ill at these numbers;] No talent for these rhymes.
2590 
2591 II.16 O most best,] An ancient mode of expression.
2592 
2593 II.17 Whilst this machine is to him,] Belongs to, obey his impulse; so long as he is "a sensible warm motion," the similar expression to "While my wits are my own."
2594 
2595 II.18 And more above,] i.e., moreover, besides.
2596 
2597 II.19 His solicitings,] i.e., his love-making, his tender expressions.
2598 
2599 II.20 If I had played the desk, or table book;] This line may either mean if I had conveyed intelligence between them, or, known of their love, if I had locked up his secret in my own breast, as closely as it were confined in a desk or table book.
2600 
2601 II.21 Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb;] i.e., connived at it.
2602 
2603 II.22 With idle sight;] i.e., with indifference.
2604 
2605 II.23 Round to work,] i.e., roundly, without reserve.
2606 
2607 II.24 Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;] She took the fruits of advice when she obeyed advice, the advice was then made fruitful.—Johnson.
2608 
2609 II.25 I'll board him presently.] Accost, address him.
2610 
2611 II.26 You are a fishmonger.] This was an expression better understood in Shakespeare's time than at present, and no doubt was relished by the audience of the Globe Theatre as applicable to the Papists, who in Queen Elizabeth's time were esteemed enemies to the Government. Hence the proverbial phrase of He's an honest man and eats no fish; to signify he's a friend to the Government and a Protestant.
2612 
2613 II.27 For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god, kissing carrion,——Have you a daughter?] i.e., Hamlet having just remarked that honesty is very rare in the world, adds, that since there is so little virtue, since corruption abounds everywhere, and maggots are bred by the sun, which is a god, even in a dead dog, Polonius ought to take care to prevent his daughter from walking in the sun, lest she should prove "a breeder of sinners;" for though conception (understanding) in general be a blessing, yet as Ophelia might chance to conceive (to be pregnant), it might be a calamity. Hamlet's abrupt question, "Have you a daughter?" is evidently intended to impress Polonius with the belief of the Prince's madness.—Malone.
2614 
2615 II.28 The satirical rogue] Hamlet alludes to Juvenal, who in his 10th Satire, describes the evils of long life.
2616 
2617 II.29 How pregnant his replies] Big with meaning.
2618 
2619 II.30 Beaten way of friendship,] Plain track, open and unceremonious course.
2620 
2621 II.31 Rights of our fellowship and constancy of our youth,] Habits of familiar intercourse and correspondent years.
2622 
2623 II.32 A better proposer] An advocate of more address in shaping his aims, who could make a stronger appeal.
2624 
2625 II.33 Even] Without inclination any way.
2626 
2627 II.34 Nay, then, I have an eye of you.] i.e., I have a glimpse of your meaning. Hamlet's penetration having shown him that his two friends are set over him as spies.
2628 
2629 II.35 So shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather.] Be beforehand with your discovery, and the plume and gloss of your secret pledge be in no feather shed or tarnished.
2630 
2631 II.36 Express] According to pattern, justly and perfectly modelled.
2632 
2633 II.37 Paragon] Model of perfection.
2634 
2635 II.38 Lenten entertainment] i.e., sparing, like the entertainments given in Lent.
2636 
2637 II.39 We coted them on the way;] To cote, is to pass by, to pass the side of another. It appears to be a word of French origin, and was a common sporting term in Shakespeare's time.
2638 
2639 II.40 The humorous man shall end his part in peace;] The fretful or capricious man shall vent the whole of his spleen undisturbed.
2640 
2641 II.41 The lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't.] i.e., the lady shall mar the measure of the verse, rather than not express herself freely and fully.
2642 
2643 II.42 Travel?] Become strollers.
2644 
2645 II.43 It is not very strange; for my uncle is king of Denmark;] This is a reflection on the mutability of fortune, and the variableness of man's mind.
2646 
2647 II.44 Make mouths at him] i.e., deride him by antic gestures and mockery.
2648 
2649 II.45 In little.] In miniature.
2650 
2651 II.46 I know a hawk from a hern-shaw.] A hernshaw is a heron or hern. To know a hawk from a hernshaw is an ancient proverb, sometimes corrupted into handsaw. Spencer quotes the proverb, as meaning, wise enough to know the hawk from its game.
2652 
2653 II.47 Buz, buz!] Sir William Blackstone states that buz used to be an interjection at Oxford when any one began a story that was generally known before.
2654 
2655 II.48 Then came each actor on his ass.] This seems to be a line of a ballad.
2656 
2657 II.49 Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light.] An English translation of the tragedies of Seneca was published in 1581, and one comedy of Plautus, viz., the Menœchme, in 1595.
2658 
2659 II.50 For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men.] The probable meaning of this passage is,—For the observance of the rules of the Drama, while they take such liberties, as are allowable, they are the only men—writ is an old word for writing.
2660 
2661 II.51 As by lot, God wot,] There was an old ballad entitled the song of Jephthah, from which these lines are probably quotations. The story of Jephthah was also one of the favourite subjects of ancient tapestry.
2662 
2663 II.52 The first row of the pious Chanson] This expression does not appear to be very well understood. Steevens tells us that the pious chansons were a kind of Christmas carols, containing some scriptural history thrown into loose rhymes, and sung about the streets. The first row appears to mean the first division of one of these.
2664 
2665 II.53 My abridgment comes.] Hamlet alludes to the players, whose approach will shorten his talk.
2666 
2667 II.54 Thy face is valanced] i.e., fringed with a beard. The valance is the fringes or drapery hanging round the tester of a bed.
2668 
2669 II.55 Com'st thou to beard me] To beard anciently meant to set at defiance. Hamlet having just told the player that his face is valanced, is playing upon the word beard.
2670 
2671 II.56 By the altitude of a chopine.] A chioppine is a high shoe, or rather clog, worn by the Italians. Venice was more famous for them than any other place. They are described as having been made of wood covered with coloured leather, and sometimes even half a yard high, their altitude being proportioned to the rank of the lady, so that they could not walk without being supported.
2672 
2673 II.57 Like French falconers,] The French seem to have been the first and noblest falconers in the western part of Europe. The French king sent over his falconers to show that sport to King James the First. —See Weldon's Court of King James.
2674 
2675 II.58 Quality;] Qualifications, faculty.
2676 
2677 II.59 Caviare to the general;] Caviare is the spawn of fish pickled, salted, and dried. It is imported from Russia, and was considered in the time of Shakespeare a new and fashionable luxury, not obtained or relished by the vulgar, and therefore used by him to signify anything above their comprehension—general is here used for the people.
2678 
2679 II.60 As much modesty as cunning.] As much propriety and decorum as skill.
2680 
2681 II.61 Falls with the whiff and wind of his fell sword] Our author employs the same image in almost the same phrase:
2682 
2683 "The Grecians fall
2684 
2685 Even in the fan and wind of your fair sword."
2686 
2687 Tr. & Cress. V. 3. Tr.
2688 
2689 II.62 The rack] The clouds or congregated vapour.
2690 
2691 II.63 The mobled queen?] Mobled is veiled, muffled, disguised.
2692 
2693 II.64 All his visage wann'd;] i.e., turned pale or wan.
2694 
2695 II.65 His whole functions suiting with forms to his conceit?] i.e., his powers and faculties—the whole energies of his soul and body giving material forms to his passion, such as tone of voice, expression of face, requisite action, in accordance with the ideas that floated in his conceit or imagination.
2696 
2697 II.66 The cue] The point—the direction.
2698 
2699 II.67 Like John a-dreams,] Or dreaming John, a name apparently coined to suit a dreaming, stupid person; he seems to have been a well-known character.
2700 
2701 II.68 Unpregnant of my cause,] i.e., not quickened with a new desire of vengeance; not teeming with revenge.
2702 
2703 II.69 Defeat was made.] Overthrow.
2704 
2705 II.70 Lack gall to make oppression bitter;] i.e., lack gall to make me feel the bitterness of oppression.
2706 
2707 II.71 Kindless] Unnatural.
2708 
2709 II.72 About, my brains!] Wits to work.
2710 
2711 II.73 I'll tent him to the quick:] i.e., probe him—search his wounds.
2712 
2713 II.74 Blench,] Shrink, start aside.
2714 
2715 II.75 More relative than this:] Directly applicable.
2716 
2717 49
2718 
2719 ACT III.
2720 Scene I.—A ROOM IN THE CASTLE.
2721 Three chairs on L.H., one on R.
2722 
2723 Enter King and Queen, preceded by Polonius. Ophelia, Rosencrantz, and Giuldenstern, following (R.H.)
2724 
2725 King. (C.) And can you, by no drift of conference,
2726 
2727 Get from him why he puts on this confusion?
2728 
2729 Ros. (R.) He does confess he feels himself distracted;
2730 
2731 But from what cause he will by no means speak.
2732 
2733 Guild. (R.) Nor do we find him forward1 to be sounded
2734 
2735 But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,
2736 
2737 When we would bring him on to some confession
2738 
2739 Of his true state.
2740 
2741 Queen. (R.C.) Did you assay him2
2742 
2743 To any pastime?
2744 
2745 Ros. Madam, it so fell out, that certain players
2746 
2747 We o'er-raught on the way:3 of these we told him;
2748 
2749 And there did seem in him a kind of joy
2750 
2751 To hear of it: They are about the court;
2752 
2753 And, as I think, they have already order
2754 
2755 This night to play before him.
2756 
2757 Pol.
2758 'Tis most true:
2759 
2760 And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
2761 
2762 To hear and see the matter.
2763 
2764 King. With all my heart; and it doth much content me
2765 
2766 To hear him so inclin'd.
2767 
2768 Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,
2769 
2770 And drive his purpose on to these delights.
2771 
2772 Ros. We shall, my lord.
2773 
2774 [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, R.H.]
2775 
2776 50King.
2777 Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
2778 
2779 For we have closely sent4 for Hamlet hither,
2780 
2781 That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
2782 
2783 Affront Ophelia:5
2784 
2785 Her father and myself (lawful espials6),
2786 
2787 Will so bestow ourselves, that, seeing, unseen,
2788 
2789 We may of their encounter frankly judge;
2790 
2791 And gather by him, as he is behaved,
2792 
2793 If't be the affliction of his love or no
2794 
2795 That thus he suffers for.
2796 
2797 Queen. (R.)
2798 I shall obey you:
2799 
2800 And for your part, Ophelia,
2801 
2802 [Ophelia comes down L.H.]
2803 
2804 I do wish
2805 
2806 That your good beauties be the happy cause
2807 
2808 Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues
2809 
2810 Will bring him to his wonted way again,
2811 
2812 To both your honours.
2813 
2814 Oph.
2815 Madam, I wish it may.
2816 
2817 [Exit Queen, R.H.]
2818 
2819 Pol. Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,
2820 
2821 We will bestow ourselves. Read on this book;
2822 
2823 [To Ophelia.]
2824 
2825 That show of such an exercise may colour
2826 
2827 Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,—
2828 
2829 'Tis too much prov'd,7 that, with devotion's visage
2830 
2831 And pious action, we do sugar o'er
2832 
2833 The devil himself.
2834 
2835 King.
2836 O, 'tis too true! how smart
2837 
2838 A lash that speech doth give my conscience! [Aside.]
2839 
2840 Pol. I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.
2841 
2842 [Exeunt King and Polonius, R.H. 2 E., and Ophelia, R.H.U.E.]
2843 
2844 Enter Hamlet (L.H.)
2845 
2846 Ham. To be, or not to be, that is the question:8
2847 
2848 51
2849 Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
2850 
2851 The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
2852 
2853 Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,9
2854 
2855 And, by opposing end them?—To die,—to sleep,
2856 
2857 No more;—and by a sleep, to say we end
2858 
2859 The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks
2860 
2861 That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation
2862 
2863 Devoutly to be wished. To die,—to sleep,—
2864 
2865 To sleep! perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
2866 
2867 For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
2868 
2869 When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,10
2870 
2871 Must give us pause:11 There's the respect12
2872 
2873 That makes calamity of so long life;
2874 
2875 For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,13
2876 
2877 The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,14
2878 
2879 The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
2880 
2881 The insolence of office, and the spurns
2882 
2883 That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
2884 
2885 When he himself might his quietus make15
2886 
2887 With a bare bodkin?16 Who would fardels bear,17
2888 
2889 To groan and sweat under a weary life,
2890 
2891 52
2892 But that the dread of something after death,
2893 
2894 The undiscovered country, from whose bourn18
2895 
2896 No traveller returns,19 puzzles the will,
2897 
2898 And makes us rather bear those ills we have
2899 
2900 Than fly to others that we know not of?
2901 
2902 Thus, conscience does make cowards of us all;20
2903 
2904 And thus the native hue of resolution
2905 
2906 Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought;
2907 
2908 And enterprises of great pith and moment,21
2909 
2910 With this regard, their currents turn away,
2911 
2912 And lose the name of action.22 [—Ophelia returns.—] Soft you now!23
2913 
2914 The fair Ophelia:—Nymph, in thy orisons24
2915 
2916 Be all my sins remember'd.
2917 
2918 Oph. (R.C.)
2919 Good my lord,
2920 
2921 How does your honour for this many a day?
2922 
2923 Ham. (L.C.) I humbly thank you; well.
2924 
2925 Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
2926 
2927 That I have longèd long to re-deliver;
2928 
2929 I pray you, now receive them.
2930 
2931 Ham.
2932 No, not I;
2933 
2934 I never gave you aught.
2935 
2936 Oph. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
2937 
2938 And, with them, words of so sweet breath compos'd
2939 
2940 As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,
2941 
2942 Take these again; for to the noble mind
2943 
2944 53
2945 Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
2946 
2947 There, my lord.
2948 
2949 Ham. Ha, ha! are you honest?
2950 
2951 Oph. My lord?
2952 
2953 Ham. Are you fair?
2954 
2955 Oph. What means your lordship?
2956 
2957 Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.25
2958 
2959 Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
2960 
2961 Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd, than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness:26 this was some time a paradox, but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
2962 
2963 Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
2964 
2965 Ham. You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock, but we shall relish of it:27 I loved you not.
2966 
2967 Oph. I was the more deceived.
2968 
2969 Ham. Get thee to a nunnery: Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest; but yet I could accuse me of such things, that it were better my mother had not borne me: I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my beck28 than I have thoughts to put them in,29 imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I do, crawling between earth and heaven? 54We are arrant knaves, all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your father?
2970 
2971 Oph. At home, my lord.
2972 
2973 Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
2974 
2975 Oph. O, help him, you sweet heavens!
2976 
2977 Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry. Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a nunnery; farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; go; go.
2978 
2979 Oph. Heavenly powers, restore him!
2980 
2981 Ham. I have heard of your paintings30 too, well enough; Heaven hath given you one face, and you make yourselves another:31 you jig, you amble, and you lisp,32 and nickname Heaven's creatures, and make your wantonness your ignorance.33 Go to, I'll no more of't; it hath made me mad. [Hamlet crosses to R.H.] I say, we will have no more marriages: those that are married already, all but one,34 shall live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery, go.
2982 
2983 [Exit Hamlet, R.H.35]
2984 
2985 Oph. (L.) O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
2986 
2987 The expectancy and rose of the fair state,36
2988 
2989 55
2990 The glass of fashion37 and the mould of form,38
2991 
2992 The observ'd of all observers, quite, quite down!
2993 
2994 And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
2995 
2996 That suck'd the honey of his musick vows,39
2997 
2998 Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
2999 
3000 Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh:
3001 
3002 O, woe is me,
3003 
3004 To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
3005 
3006 [Exit Ophelia, L.H.]
3007 
3008 Re-enter King and Polonius.
3009 
3010 King. Love! his affections do not that way tend;
3011 
3012 Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
3013 
3014 Was not like madness. There's something in his soul,
3015 
3016 O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
3017 
3018 He shall with speed to England,
3019 
3020 For the demand of our neglected tribute:
3021 
3022 Haply, the seas, and countries different,
3023 
3024 With variable objects, shall expel
3025 
3026 This something-settled matter in his heart;
3027 
3028 Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
3029 
3030 From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
3031 
3032 Pol. It shall do well: But yet I do believe
3033 
3034 The origin and commencement of his grief
3035 
3036 Sprung from neglected love. My lord, do as you please;
3037 
3038 But, if you hold it fit, after the play,
3039 
3040 Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
3041 
3042 To show his grief: let her be round with him;40
3043 
3044 And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear
3045 
3046 Of all their conference. If she find him not,41
3047 
3048 To England send him; or confine him where
3049 
3050 Your wisdom best shall think.
3051 
3052 King.
3053 It shall be so:
3054 
3055 Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.
3056 
3057 [Exeunt, L.H.]
3058 
3059 56Enter Hamlet and a Player (R.H.)
3060 
3061 Ham. (C.) Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it, as many of our players do, I had as lief42 the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hands thus;43 but use all gently: for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say) whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul, to hear a robustious perrywig-pated fellow44 tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings,45 who, for the most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise: I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant;46 it out-herods Herod:47 Pray you, avoid it.
3062 
3063 1st Play. (R.) I warrant your honour.
3064 
3065 Ham. Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your tutor; suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, 57scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time its form and pressure.48 Now, this overdone, or come tardy off,49 though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of which one50 must, in your allowance,51 o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,52 that, neither having the accent of christians, nor the gait of christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed, that I have thought some of nature's journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.
3066 
3067 [Crosses to R.]
3068 
3069 1st Play. (L.) I hope we have reformed that indifferently53 with us.
3070 
3071 Ham. O, reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them:54 for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators55 to laugh too; though, in the mean time, some necessary question56 of the play be then to be considered: that's villainous, and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.
3072 
3073 [Exit Player, L.H.]
3074 
3075 Ham. What, ho, Horatio!
3076 
3077 Enter Horatio (R.H.)
3078 
3079 Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your service.
3080 
3081 58Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
3082 
3083 As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.57
3084 
3085 Hor. O, my dear lord.
3086 Ham.
3087 Nay, do not think I flatter;
3088 
3089 For what advancement may I hope from thee,
3090 
3091 That no revenue hast, but thy good spirits,
3092 
3093 To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
3094 
3095 No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp;
3096 
3097 And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee,58
3098 
3099 Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
3100 
3101 Since my dear soul59 was mistress of her choice,
3102 
3103 And could of men distinguish, her election
3104 
3105 Hath seal'd thee for herself: for thou hast been
3106 
3107 As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing;
3108 
3109 A man that fortune's buffets and rewards
3110 
3111 Has ta'en with equal thanks: and bless'd are those
3112 
3113 Whose blood and judgment60 are so well co-mingled,
3114 
3115 That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger
3116 
3117 To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
3118 
3119 That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
3120 
3121 In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
3122 
3123 As I do thee.—Something too much of this.—
3124 
3125 There is a play to-night before the king;
3126 
3127 One scene of it comes near the circumstance
3128 
3129 Which I have told thee of my father's death:
3130 
3131 I pr'ythee when thou seest that act a-foot,
3132 
3133 Even with the very comment of thy soul61
3134 
3135 Observe my uncle: if his occulted guilt62
3136 
3137 59
3138 Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
3139 
3140 It is a damned ghost that we have seen;
3141 
3142 And my imaginations are as foul
3143 
3144 As Vulcan's stithy.63 Give him heedful note:
3145 
3146 For I mine eyes will rivet to his face;
3147 
3148 And, after, we will both our judgments join
3149 
3150 In censure of his seeming.64
3151 
3152 [Horatio goes off, U.E.L.H.]
3153 
3154 March. Enter King and Queen, preceded by Polonius, Ophelia, Horatio, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, Lords, Ladies, and Attendants. King and Queen sit (L.H.); Ophelia (R.H.)
3155 
3156 King. (L.) How fares our cousin Hamlet?
3157 
3158 Ham. (C.) Excellent, i'faith; of the cameleon's dish: I eat the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.
3159 
3160 King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not mine.65
3161 
3162 Ham. No, nor mine, now.66 My lord,—you played once in the university, you say?67 [To Polonius, L.]
3163 
3164 Pol. (L.C.) That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.
3165 
3166 Ham. (C.) And what did you enact?
3167 
3168 Pol. I did enact Julius Cæsar:68 I was killed i'the Capitol; Brutus killed me.
3169 
3170 Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there.—Be the players ready?
3171 
3172 Ros. Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.69
3173 
3174 Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
3175 
3176 [Pointing to a chair by her side.]
3177 
3178 60Ham. No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.
3179 
3180 Pol. O, ho! do you mark that?
3181 
3182 [Aside to the King.]
3183 
3184 Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
3185 
3186 [Lying down at Ophelia's feet.]70
3187 
3188 Oph. (R.) You are merry, my lord.
3189 
3190 Ham. O, your only jig-maker.71 What should a man do but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.
3191 
3192 Oph. Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.
3193 
3194 Ham. So long? Nay, then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a suit of sables.72 O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half a year: But, by'r-lady, he must build churches, then.73
3195 
3196 Oph. What means the play, my lord?
3197 
3198 Ham. Miching mallecho;74 it means mischief.
3199 
3200 Oph. But what is the argument of the play?
3201 
3202 Enter a Player as Prologue (L.H.) on a raised stage.
3203 
3204 Ham. We shall know by this fellow.
3205 
3206 Pro.
3207 
3208 For us, and for our tragedy,
3209 
3210 Here stooping to your clemency,
3211 
3212 We beg your hearing patiently.
3213 
3214 [Exit, L.H.]
3215 
3216 61Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?75
3217 
3218 Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.
3219 
3220 Ham. As woman's love.
3221 
3222 Enter a King and a Queen (L.H.) on raised stage.
3223 
3224 P. King. (R.) Full thirty times hath Phœbus' cart76 gone round
3225 
3226 Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbèd ground,77
3227 
3228 Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
3229 
3230 Unite commutual in most sacred bands.
3231 
3232 P. Queen. (L.) So many journeys may the sun and moon
3233 
3234 Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
3235 
3236 But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
3237 
3238 So far from cheer and from your former state,
3239 
3240 That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
3241 
3242 Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must.
3243 
3244 P. King. 'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
3245 
3246 My operant powers their functions leave to do:78
3247 
3248 And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
3249 
3250 Honour'd, belov'd; and, haply one as kind
3251 
3252 For husband shalt thou——
3253 
3254 P. Queen.
3255 O, confound the rest!
3256 
3257 Such love must needs be treason in my breast:
3258 
3259 In second husband let me be accurst!
3260 
3261 None wed the second but who kill'd the first.
3262 
3263 Ham. That's wormwood.
3264 
3265 [Aside to Horatio, R.]
3266 
3267 P. King. I do believe you think what now you speak;
3268 
3269 But what we do determine oft we break.79
3270 
3271 So think you thou wilt no second husband wed;
3272 
3273 But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
3274 
3275 62P. Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
3276 
3277 Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
3278 
3279 Both here, and hence, pursue me lasting strife,
3280 
3281 If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
3282 
3283 P. King. 'Tis deeply sworn.
3284 
3285 Ham. If she should break it now!—
3286 
3287 [To Ophelia.]
3288 
3289 P. King. Sweet, leave me here awhile;
3290 
3291 My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
3292 
3293 The tedious day with sleep.
3294 
3295 [Reposes on a bank, R., and sleeps.]
3296 
3297 P. Queen.
3298 Sleep rock thy brain;
3299 
3300 And never come mischance between us twain!
3301 
3302 [Exit, L.H.]
3303 
3304 Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
3305 
3306 Queen. The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
3307 
3308 Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
3309 
3310 King. Have you heard the argument?80 Is there no offence in't?
3311 
3312 Ham. No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i'the world.
3313 
3314 King. What do you call the play?
3315 
3316 Ham. The mouse-trap.81 Marry, how? Tropically.82 This play is the image of a murder83 done in Vienna: Gonzago is the Duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you shall see anon;—'tis a knavish piece of work: but what of that? your majesty, and we that have free souls, it touches us not: Let the galled jade wince,84 our withers85 are unwrung.
3317 
3318 Enter Lucianus (L.H.)
3319 
3320 This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.
3321 
3322 63Oph. You are as good as a chorus,86 my lord.
3323 
3324 Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see the puppets dallying.87 Begin, murderer; leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:—
3325 
3326 —— The croaking raven
3327 
3328 Doth bellow for revenge.88
3329 
3330 Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
3331 
3332 Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
3333 
3334 Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds89 collected,
3335 
3336 With Hecat's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
3337 
3338 Thy natural magick and dire property,
3339 
3340 On wholesome life usurp90 immediately.
3341 
3342 [Pours the poison into the Sleeper's Ears.]
3343 
3344 Ham. He poisons him i' the garden for his estate. His name's Gonzago: the story is extant, and written in very choice Italian: You shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago's wife.
3345 
3346 King. Give me some light: away!
3347 
3348 All. Lights, lights, lights!
3349 
3350 [Exeunt all, R. and L., but Hamlet and Horatio.]
3351 
3352 Ham.
3353 
3354 Why, let the strucken deer go weep,91
3355 
3356 64
3357 The hart ungallèd play;
3358 
3359 For some must watch, while some must sleep:
3360 
3361 So runs the world away.—
3362 
3363 O, good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand pounds. Didst perceive?
3364 
3365 Hor. (R.) Very well, my lord.
3366 
3367 Ham. (C.) Upon the talk of the poisoning.—
3368 
3369 Hor. I did very well note him.
3370 
3371 Ham. Ah, ah! come, some musick! come, the recorders!
3372 
3373 [Exit Horatio, R.H.]
3374 
3375 Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (L.H.) Hamlet seats himself in the chair (R.)
3376 
3377 Guil. (L.C.) Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
3378 
3379 Ham. Sir, a whole history.
3380 
3381 Guil. The king, sir,——
3382 
3383 Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
3384 
3385 Guil. Is, in his retirement, marvellous distempered.92
3386 
3387 Ham. With drink, sir?
3388 
3389 Guil. No, my lord, with choler.
3390 
3391 Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more rich to signify this to the doctor; for, for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into more choler.
3392 
3393 Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start not so wildly from my affair.
3394 
3395 Ham. I am tame, sir:—pronounce.
3396 
3397 Guil. The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit, hath sent me to you.
3398 
3399 Ham. You are welcome.
3400 
3401 Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed. If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do your mother's commandment: if not, your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business.
3402 
3403 Ham. Sir, I cannot.
3404 
3405 Guil. What, my lord?
3406 
3407 Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased! But, sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command: or rather as you say, my mother: therefore no more, but to the matter: My mother, you say,—
3408 
3409 65Ros. (Crosses to C.) Then thus she says: Your behaviour hath struck her into amazement and admiration.93
3410 
3411 Ham. O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration?—impart.
3412 
3413 Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you go to bed.
3414 
3415 Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any further trade with us?94
3416 
3417 Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
3418 
3419 Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers.95
3420 
3421 [Rises and comes forward, C.]
3422 
3423 Ros. (R.) Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you do, surely, bar the door of your own liberty, if you deny your griefs to your friend.96
3424 
3425 Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
3426 
3427 Ros. How can that be, when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in Denmark?97
3428 
3429 Ham. Ay, sir, but While the grass grows,—the proverb is something musty.98
3430 
3431 Enter Horatio and Musicians (R.H.)
3432 
3433 O, the recorders:99—let me see one.—So; withdraw with you:—
3434 
3435 [Exeunt Horatio and Musicians R.H. Guildenstern, after speaking privately to Rosencrantz, crosses behind Hamlet to R.H.]
3436 
3437 66Why do you go about to recover the wind of me,100 as if you would drive me into a toil?101
3438 
3439 Guil. (R.) O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.102
3440 
3441 Ham. (C.) I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?
3442 
3443 Guil. My lord, I cannot.
3444 
3445 Ham. I pray you.
3446 
3447 Guil. Believe me, I cannot.
3448 
3449 Ham. I do beseech you.
3450 
3451 Ros. (L.) I know no touch of it, my lord.
3452 
3453 Ham. 'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with your fingers and thumb, give it breath with your mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music.103 Look you, these are the stops.
3454 
3455 Guil. But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony; I have not the skill.
3456 
3457 Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass: and there is much music, excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot you make it speak. 'Sdeath, do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me, you cannot play upon me.104
3458 
3459 [Crosses to L.H.]
3460 
3461 Enter Polonius (R.H.)
3462 
3463 Pol. (R.) My lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently.
3464 
3465 67Ham. (C.) Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
3466 
3467 Pol. By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.
3468 
3469 Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
3470 
3471 Pol. It is backed like a weasel.
3472 
3473 Ham. Or like a whale?
3474 
3475 Pol. Very like a whale.
3476 
3477 Ham. Then will I come to my mother by and by. They fool me to the top of my bent.105 I will come by and by.
3478 
3479 Pol. I will say so.
3480 
3481 Ham. By and by is easily said.
3482 
3483 [Exit Polonius, R.H.
3484 
3485 Leave me, friends.
3486 
3487 [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, R.H.]
3488 
3489 'Tis now the very witching time of night,
3490 
3491 When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
3492 
3493 Contagion to this world: Now could I drink hot blood,
3494 
3495 And do such bitter business106 as the day
3496 
3497 Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.
3498 
3499 O, heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
3500 
3501 The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:
3502 
3503 Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
3504 
3505 I will speak daggers to her, but use none.
3506 
3507 [Exit]
3508 
3509 Scene II.—A ROOM IN THE SAME.
3510 Enter King, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (R.H.)
3511 
3512 King. I like him not; nor stands it safe with us107
3513 
3514 To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
3515 
3516 I your commission will forthwith despatch,
3517 
3518 And he to England shall along with you:
3519 
3520 Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
3521 
3522 68
3523 For we will fetters put upon this fear,108
3524 
3525 Which now goes too free-booted.
3526 
3527 Ros.
3528 
3529 Guil.
3530 
3531 We will haste us.
3532 
3533 [Cross behind the King, and exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, L.H.]
3534 
3535 Enter Polonius (R.H.)
3536 
3537 Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:
3538 
3539 Behind the arras I'll convey myself,109
3540 
3541 To hear the process;110 I'll warrant, she'll tax him home:
3542 
3543 And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
3544 
3545 'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
3546 
3547 Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
3548 
3549 The speech of vantage.111 Fare you well, my liege:
3550 
3551 [Polonius crosses to L.H.]
3552 
3553 I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,
3554 
3555 And tell you what I know.
3556 
3557 King.
3558 Thanks, dear my lord.
3559 
3560 [Exeunt Polonius, L.H., and King, R.H.]
3561 
3562 Scene III.—THE QUEEN'S CHAMBER.
3563 Enter Queen and Polonius (L.H.)
3564 
3565 Pol. He will come straight. Look, you lay home to him:112
3566 
3567 Tell him his pranks have been too broad113 to bear with,
3568 
3569 And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between
3570 
3571 69
3572 Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here.114
3573 
3574 Pray you, be round with him.
3575 
3576 Queen.
3577 I'll warrant you;
3578 
3579 Fear me not:—withdraw, I hear him coming.
3580 
3581 [Polonius hides himself, L.H.U.E.]
3582 
3583 Enter Hamlet (R.)
3584 
3585 Ham. (R.C.) Now, mother, what's the matter?
3586 
3587 Queen. (L.C.) Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
3588 
3589 Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended.
3590 
3591 Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
3592 
3593 Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
3594 
3595 Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet!
3596 
3597 Ham.
3598 What's the matter now?
3599 
3600 Queen. Have you forgot me?
3601 
3602 Ham.
3603 No, by the rood,115 not so:
3604 
3605 You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife;
3606 
3607 And—would it were not so!—you are my mother.
3608 
3609 Queen. Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.
3610 
3611 Ham. Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;
3612 
3613 You go not till I set you up a glass
3614 
3615 Where you may see the inmost part of you.
3616 
3617 Queen. What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?
3618 
3619 Help, help, ho!
3620 
3621 Pol. (Behind.) What, ho! help!
3622 
3623 Ham.
3624 How now! a rat?116
3625 
3626 [Draws.]
3627 
3628 Dead, for a ducat, dead!
3629 
3630 [Hamlet rushes off behind the arras.]
3631 
3632 Pol. (Behind.)
3633 O, I am slain!
3634 
3635 [Falls and dies.]
3636 
3637 Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
3638 
3639 Ham. (Returning.)
3640 Nay, I know not:
3641 
3642 Is it the king?
3643 
3644 70Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
3645 
3646 Ham. A bloody deed!—almost as bad, good mother,
3647 
3648 As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
3649 
3650 Queen. As kill a king!
3651 
3652 Ham.
3653 Ay, lady, 'twas my word.
3654 
3655 [Goes off behind the arras, and returns.]
3656 
3657 Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
3658 
3659 [To the dead body of Polonius, behind the arras.]
3660 
3661 I took thee for thy better.
3662 
3663 Leave wringing of your hands: Peace; sit you down,
3664 
3665 [To the Queen.]
3666 
3667 And let me wring your heart: for so I shall,
3668 
3669 If it be made of penetrable stuff;
3670 
3671 If damnèd custom have not brazed it so,117
3672 
3673 That it be proof and bulwark against sense.118
3674 
3675 Queen. (Sits R.C.) What have I done, that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
3676 
3677 In noise so rude against me?
3678 
3679 Ham. (Seated L.C.)
3680 Such an act,
3681 
3682 That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
3683 
3684 Calls virtue, hypocrite; takes off the rose
3685 
3686 From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
3687 
3688 And sets a blister there;119 makes marriage vows
3689 
3690 As false as dicer's oaths: O, such a deed
3691 
3692 As from the body of contraction plucks
3693 
3694 The very soul;120 and sweet religion makes
3695 
3696 A rhapsody of words.—
3697 
3698 Ah, me, that act!
3699 
3700 Queen.
3701 Ah me, what act?
3702 
3703 Ham. Look here, upon this picture, and on this,
3704 
3705 71
3706 The counterfeit presentment121 of two brothers.
3707 
3708 See, what a grace was seated on this brow;
3709 
3710 Hypérion's curls;122 the front of Jove himself;
3711 
3712 An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
3713 
3714 A station like the herald Mercury123
3715 
3716 New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;
3717 
3718 A combination, and a form, indeed,
3719 
3720 Where every god did seem to set his seal,
3721 
3722 To give the world assurance of a man;
3723 
3724 This was your husband.—Look you now, what follows:
3725 
3726 Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,
3727 
3728 Blasting his wholesome brother.124 Have you eyes?
3729 
3730 Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
3731 
3732 And batten on this moor?125 Ha! have you eyes?
3733 
3734 You cannot call it love; for, at your age
3735 
3736 The hey-day in the blood126 is tame, it's humble,
3737 
3738 And waits upon the judgment: And what judgment
3739 
3740 Would step from this to this?
3741 
3742 O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
3743 
3744 If thou canst mutine,127 in a matron's bones,
3745 
3746 To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
3747 
3748 And melt in her own fire.
3749 
3750 Queen. O, Hamlet, speak no more:
3751 
3752 Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
3753 
3754 And there I see such black and grainèd spots
3755 
3756 As will not leave their tinct.128
3757 
3758 72Ham.
3759 Nay, but to live
3760 
3761 In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,——129
3762 
3763 Queen. O, speak to me no more;
3764 
3765 No more, sweet Hamlet!
3766 
3767 Ham.
3768 A murderer and a villain:
3769 
3770 A slave that is not twentieth part the tythe
3771 
3772 Of your precedent lord;—a vice of kings;130
3773 
3774 A cutpurse of the empire and the rule;
3775 
3776 That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,
3777 
3778 And put it in his pocket!131
3779 
3780 Queen.
3781 No more!
3782 
3783 Ham.
3784 A king
3785 
3786 Of shreds and patches.132
3787 
3788 Enter Ghost, R.
3789 
3790 Save me [Starts from his chair], and hover o'er me with your wings,
3791 
3792 You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
3793 
3794 Queen. Alas, he's mad!
3795 
3796 [Rising.]
3797 
3798 Ham. (L.) Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
3799 
3800 That, laps'd in time and passion,133 lets go by
3801 
3802 The important acting of your dread command?
3803 
3804 O, say!
3805 
3806 Ghost. (R.) Do not forget: This visitation
3807 
3808 Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
3809 
3810 But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:
3811 
3812 O, step between her and her fighting soul.
3813 
3814 Speak to her Hamlet.
3815 
3816 Ham.
3817 How is it with you, lady?
3818 
3819 73Queen. Alas, how is't with you,
3820 
3821 That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
3822 
3823 And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
3824 
3825 Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep.
3826 
3827 O gentle son,
3828 
3829 [Crosses to Hamlet.]
3830 
3831 Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
3832 
3833 Sprinkle cool patience.134 Whereon do you look?
3834 
3835 Ham. On him, on him!—Look you, how pale he glares!
3836 
3837 His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
3838 
3839 Would make them capable.135 Do not look upon me;
3840 
3841 Lest with this piteous action, you convert
3842 
3843 My stern effects:136 then what I have to do
3844 
3845 Will want true colour; tears perchance, for blood.
3846 
3847 Queen. To whom do you speak this?
3848 
3849 Ham.
3850 Do you see nothing there?
3851 
3852 Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is, I see.137
3853 
3854 Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
3855 
3856 Queen.
3857 No, nothing but ourselves.
3858 
3859 Ham. Why, look you there! look, how it steals away!
3860 
3861 [Ghost crosses to L.]
3862 
3863 My father in his habit as he lived!138
3864 
3865 Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!
3866 
3867 [Exit Ghost, L.H. Hamlet sinks into chair C. The Queen falls on her knees by his side.]
3868 
3869 Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain:
3870 
3871 This bodiless creation ecstasy
3872 
3873 Is very cunning in.139
3874 
3875 74Ham. Ecstasy!
3876 
3877 My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
3878 
3879 And makes as healthful music: It is not madness
3880 
3881 That I have uttered: bring me to the test,
3882 
3883 And I the matter will re-word; which madness
3884 
3885 Would gambol from.140 Mother, for love of grace,
3886 
3887 [Rising.]
3888 
3889 Lay not that flattering unction to your soul,
3890 
3891 That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:
3892 
3893 It will but skin and film141 the ulcerous place,
3894 
3895 Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
3896 
3897 Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
3898 
3899 Repent what's past; avoid what is to come.
3900 
3901 Queen. O, Hamlet! thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
3902 
3903 Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
3904 
3905 And live the purer with the other half.
3906 
3907 Good night: but go not to my uncle's bed;
3908 
3909 [Raising the Queen.]
3910 
3911 Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
3912 
3913 Once more, good night!
3914 
3915 And when you are desirous to be bless'd,
3916 
3917 I'll blessing beg of you.142 For this same lord,
3918 
3919 [Pointing to Polonius.]
3920 
3921 I do repent:
3922 
3923 I will bestow him, and will answer well
3924 
3925 The death I gave him. So, again, good night.
3926 
3927 [Exit Queen, R.H.]
3928 
3929 I must be cruel, only to be kind:
3930 
3931 Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
3932 
3933 [Exit Hamlet behind the arras, L.H.U.E.]
3934 
3935 END OF ACT THIRD.
3936 Notes
3937 Act III
3938 
3939 III.1 Forward] Disposed, inclinable.
3940 
3941 III.2 Assay him to] Try his disposition towards.
3942 
3943 III.3 O'er-raught on the way:] Reached or overtook.
3944 
3945 III.4 Have closely sent] i.e., privately sent.
3946 
3947 III.5 May here affront Ophelia:] To affront is to come face to face—to confront.
3948 
3949 III.6 Lawful espials,] Spies justifiably inquisitive. From the French, espier.
3950 
3951 III.7 Too much prov'd,] Found by too frequent experience.
3952 
3953 III.8 To be, or not to be, that is the question:] Hamlet is deliberating whether he should continue to live, or put an end to his existence.
3954 
3955 III.9 Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,] A sea of troubles among the Greeks grew into a proverbial usage; so that the expression figuratively means, the troubles of human life, which flow in upon us, and encompass us round like a sea.
3956 
3957 III.10 This mortal coil,] Coil is here used in each of its senses, that of turmoil or bustle, and that which entwines or wraps round.
3958 
3959 III.11 Must give us pause:] i.e., occasion for reflection.
3960 
3961 III.12
3962 
3963 There's the respect
3964 That makes calamity of so long life;] The consideration that makes the evils of life so long submitted to, lived under.
3965 
3966 III.13 The whips and scorns of time,] Those sufferings of body and mind, those stripes and mortifications to which, in its course, the life of man is subjected.
3967 
3968 III.14 Contumely,] Contemptuousness, rudeness.
3969 
3970 III.15 His quietus make] Quietus means the official discharge of an account: from the Latin. Particularly in the Exchequer accounts, where it is still current. Chiefly used by authors in metaphorical senses.
3971 
3972 III.16 A bare bodkin?] Bodkin was an ancient term for a small dagger. In the margin of Stowe's Chronicle it is said that Cæsar was slain with bodkins.
3973 
3974 III.17 Who would fardels bear,] Fardel is a burden. Fardellus, low Latin.
3975 
3976 III.18 From whose bourn] i.e., boundary.
3977 
3978 III.19 No traveller returns,] The traveller whom Hamlet had seen, though he appeared in the same habit which he had worn in his life-time, was nothing but a shadow, "invulnerable as the air," and, consequently, incorporeal. The Ghost has given us no account of the region from whence he came, being, as he himself informed us, "forbid to tell the secrets of his prison-house."—Malone.
3979 
3980 III.20 Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;] A state of doubt and uncertainty, a conscious feeling or apprehension, a misgiving "How our audit stands."
3981 
3982 III.21 Of great pith and moment,] i.e., of great vigour and importance.
3983 
3984 III.22
3985 
3986 With this regard, their currents turn away,
3987 And lose the name of action.]
3988

3995 III.25 If you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.] i.e., if you really possess these qualities, chastity and beauty, and mean to support the character of both, your honesty should be so chary of your beauty, as not to suffer a thing so fragile to entertain discourse, or to be parleyed with.
3996 
3997 The lady interprets the words otherwise, giving them the turn best suited to her purpose.
3998 
3999 III.26 His likeness:] Shakespeare and his contemporaries frequently use the personal for the neutral pronoun.
4000 
4001 III.27 Inoculate our old stock, but we shall relish of it:] So change the original constitution and properties, as that no smack of them shall remain. "Inoculate our stock" are terms in gardening.

4004 
4005 III.29 Than I have thoughts to put them in, &c.] "To put a thing into thought," Johnson says, is "to think on it."
4006 
4007 III.30 I have heard of your paintings,] These destructive aids of beauty seem, in the time of Shakespeare, to have been general objects of satire.
4008 
4009 III.31 Heaven hath given you one face, and you make yourselves another:] i.e., Heaven hath given you one face, and you disfigure his image by making yourself another.
4010 
4011 III.32 You jig, you amble, and you lisp,] This is an allusion to the manners of the age, which Shakespeare, in the spirit of his contemporaries, means here to satirise.
4012 
4013 III.33 Make your wantonness your ignorance.] You mistake by wanton affectation, and pretend to mistake by ignorance.
4014 
4015 III.34 All but one shall live;] One is the king.
4016 
4017 III.35 To a nunnery, go. Exit Hamlet.] There is no doubt that Hamlet's attachment to Ophelia is ardent and sincere, but he treats her with apparent severity because he is aware that Ophelia has been purposely thrown in his way; that spies are about them; and that it is necessary for the preservation of his life, to assume a conduct which he thought would be attributed to madness only.

4037 III.45 The ears of the groundlings,] The meaner people appear to have occupied the pit of the theatre (which had neither floor nor benches in Shakespeare's time), as they now sit in the upper gallery.
4038 
4039 III.46 O'er-doing Termagant;] The Crusaders, and those who celebrated them, confounded Mahometans with Pagans, and supposed Mahomet, or Mahound, to be one of their deities, and Tervagant or Termagant, another. This imaginary personage was introduced into our old plays and moralities, and represented as of a most violent character, so that a ranting actor might always appear to advantage in it. The word is now used for a scolding woman.
4040 
4041 III.47 It out-herods Herod:] In all the old moralities and mysteries this personage was always represented as a tyrant of a very violent temper, using the most exaggerated language. Hence the expression.

4054 
4055 III.54 Speak no more them is set down for them:] Shakespeare alludes to a custom of his time, when the clown, or low comedian, as he would now be called, addressing the audience during the play, entered into a contest of raillery and sarcasm with such spectators as chose to engage with him.

4066 
4067 III.60 Whose blood and judgment] Dr. Johnson says that according to the doctrine of the four humours, desire and confidence were seated in the blood, and judgment in the phlegm, and the due mixture of the humours made a perfect character.

4070

4077 III.65 I have nothing with this answer; these words are not mine.] i.e., they grow not out of mine: have no relation to anything said by me.
4078 
4079 III.66 No, nor mine, now.] They are now anybody's. Dr. Johnson observes, "a man's words, says the proverb, are his own no longer than while he keeps them unspoken."
4080 
4081 III.67 You played once in the university, you say?] The practice of acting Latin plays in the universities of Oxford and Cambridge is very ancient, and continued to near the middle of the last century.

4090 
4091 III.72 For I'll have a suit of sables.] Wherever his scene might be, the customs of his country were ever in Shakespeare's thoughts. A suit trimmed with sables was in our author's own time the richest dress worn by men in England. By the Statute of Apparel, 24 Henry VIII., c. 13, (article furres), it is ordained, that none under the degree of an Earl may use sables.
4092 
4093 III.73 He must build churches, then.] Such benefactors to society were sure to be recorded by means of the feast day on which the patron saints and founders of churches were commemorated in every parish. This custom has long since ceased.
4094 
4095 III.74 Miching mallecho;] To mich is a provincial word, signifying to lie hid, or to skulk, or act by stealth. It was probably once generally used. Mallecho is supposed to be corrupted from the Spanish Malechor, which means a poisoner.

4123 III.86 You are as good as a chorus,] The persons who are supposed to behold what passes in the acts of a tragedy, and sing their sentiments between the acts.
4124 
4125 The use to which Shakespeare converted the chorus, may be seen in King Henry V.
4126 
4127 III.87 I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see the puppets dallying.] This refers to the interpreter, who formerly sat on the stage at all puppet shows, and explained to the audience. The puppets dallying are here made to signify to the agitations of Ophelia's bosom.

4129 III.88
4130 
4131 The croaking raven
4132 
4133 Doth bellow for revenge.]
4134 
4135 i.e., begin without more delay; for the raven, foreknowing the deed, is already croaking, and, as it were, calling out for the revenge which will ensue.
4136

4141 III.90 Usurp] Encroach upon.
4142 
4143 III.91 Let the strucken deer go weep,] Shakespeare, in As you like it, in allusion to the wounded stag, speaks of the big round tears which cours'd one another down his innocent nose in piteous chase.

4155 III.97 You have the voice of the king himself for your succession in Denmark?] Though the crown was elective, yet regard was paid to the recommendation of the preceding prince, and preference given to royal blood, which, by degrees, produced hereditary succession.
4156 
4157 III.98 "While the grass grows,"—the proverb is something musty.] The proverb is, "While the grass grows, the steed starves." Hamlet alludes to his own position, while waiting for his succession to the throne of Denmark. A similar adage is, "A slip between the cup and the lip."

4235 From a shelf the precious diadem stole,
4236 
4237 And put it in his pocket!
4238

4278 Scene I.—A ROOM IN THE CASTLE.
4279 Enter King and Queen, from (R.H.) centre.
4280 
4281 King. There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:
4282 
4283 You must translate:1 'tis fit we understand them.
4284 
4285 How does Hamlet?
4286 
4287 Queen. Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend
4288 
4289 Which is the mightier: In his lawless fit,
4290 
4291 Behind the arras hearing something stir,
4292 
4293 Whips out his rapier, cries A rat, a rat!
4294 
4295 And, in this brainish apprehension,2 kills
4296 
4297 The unseen good old man.
4298 
4299 King.
4300 O heavy deed!
4301 
4302 It had been so with us, had we been there:
4303 
4304 Where is he gone?
4305 
4306 Queen. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd.
4307 
4308 King. The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,
4309 
4310 But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed
4311 
4312 We must, with all our majesty and skill,
4313 
4314 Both countenance and excuse.—Ho, Guildenstern!
4315 
4316 Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (L.H.)
4317 
4318 Friends both, go join you with some further aid:
4319 
4320 Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
4321 
4322 And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:
4323 
4324 Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
4325 
4326 Into the chapel.
4327 
4328 [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern cross to R.]
4329 
4330 76
4331 I pray you, haste in this.
4332 
4333 [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, R.H.]
4334 
4335 Go, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;
4336 
4337 And let them know, both what we mean to do,
4338 
4339 And what's untimely done.
4340 
4341 [Exit Queen, R.C.]
4342 
4343 How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
4344 
4345 Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
4346 
4347 He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
4348 
4349 Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
4350 
4351 And where 'tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,
4352 
4353 But never the offence.3
4354 
4355 Enter Rosencrantz (R.)
4356 
4357 How now! what hath befallen?
4358 
4359 Ros. Where the dead body is bestowed, my lord,
4360 
4361 We cannot get from him.
4362 
4363 King.
4364 But where is he?
4365 
4366 Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
4367 
4368 King. Bring him before us.
4369 
4370 Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.
4371 
4372 Enter Hamlet, Guildenstern, and Attendants (R.H.)
4373 
4374 King. (C.) Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
4375 
4376 Ham. (R.) At supper.
4377 
4378 King. At supper? Where?
4379 
4380 Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain convocation of politick worms4 are e'en at him.
4381 
4382 King. Where's Polonius?
4383 
4384 Ham. In Heaven; send thither to see: if your messenger find him not there, seek him i'the other place yourself. But, indeed, if you find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby.
4385 
4386 King. Go seek him there. [To Guildenstern.]
4387 
4388 77Ham. He will stay till you come.
4389 
4390 [Exit Guildenstern, R.H.]
4391 
4392 King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,
4393 
4394 Must send thee hence:
4395 
4396 Therefore prepare thyself;
4397 
4398 The bark is ready, and the wind at help,5
4399 
4400 For England.
4401 
4402 Ham.
4403 For England!
4404 
4405 King.
4406 Ay, Hamlet.
4407 
4408 Ham.
4409 Good.
4410 
4411 King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
4412 
4413 Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for England!—Farewell, dear mother.
4414 
4415 King. Thy loving father, Hamlet.
4416 
4417 Ham. My mother: Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England.
4418 
4419 [Exit, R.H.]
4420 
4421 King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;
4422 
4423 Away! for everything is seal'd and done.
4424 
4425 [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Attendants, R.H.]
4426 
4427 And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,
4428 
4429 Thou may'st not coldly set6
4430 
4431 Our sovereign process;7 which imports at full,
4432 
4433 By letters conjuring to that effect,8
4434 
4435 The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
4436 
4437 For thou must cure me: 'Till I know 'tis done,
4438 
4439 Howe'er my haps,9 my joys will ne'er begin.
4440 
4441 [Exit King, L.H.]
4442 
4443 Enter Queen and Horatio R. centre.
4444 
4445 Queen. —— I will not speak with her.
4446 
4447 Hor. She is importunate; indeed, distract:
4448 
4449 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
4450 
4451 Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
4452 
4453 Queen. Let her come in.
4454 
4455 [Exit Horatio, R.C.]
4456 
4457 78Re-enter Horatio, with Ophelia R. centre.
4458 
4459 Oph. Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?
4460 
4461 Queen. How now, Ophelia!
4462 
4463 Oph. (C.)
4464 [Singing.]
4465 
4466 How should I your true love know
4467 
4468 From another one?
4469 
4470 By his cockle hat and staff,
4471 
4472 And his sandal shoon.10
4473 
4474 Queen. (L.C.) Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
4475 
4476 Oph. Say you? nay, pray you, mark.
4477 
4478 [Sings.]
4479 
4480 He is dead and gone, lady,
4481 
4482 He is dead and gone;
4483 
4484 At his head a grass-green turf,
4485 
4486 At his heels a stone.
4487 
4488 Enter the King (L.H.)
4489 
4490 Queen. Nay, but, Ophelia,——
4491 
4492 Oph.
4493 Pray you, mark.
4494 
4495 [Sings.]
4496 
4497 White his shroud as the mountain-snow,
4498 
4499 Larded all with sweet flowers;11
4500 
4501 Which bewept to the grave did go
4502 
4503 With true-love showers.
4504 
4505 King. How do you, pretty lady?
4506 
4507 Oph. Well, Heaven 'ield you!12 (Crosses to the King.)
4508 
4509 They say the owl was a baker's daughter.13 We know what we are, but know not what we may be.
4510 
4511 King. Conceit upon her father.14
4512 
4513 Oph. Pray, you, let us have no words of this; but when they ask you what it means, say you this:
4514 
4515 To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
4516 
4517 All in the morning betime,
4518 
4519 79
4520 And I, a maid at your window,
4521 
4522 To be your Valentine:
4523 
4524 King. Pretty Ophelia!
4525 
4526 Oph. Indeed, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:
4527 
4528 Then up he rose, and don'd his clothes,
4529 
4530 And dupp'd15 the chamber door;
4531 
4532 Let in the maid, that out a maid
4533 
4534 Never departed more.
4535 
4536 [Crosses to R.H.]
4537 
4538 King. (L.) How long hath she been thus?
4539 
4540 Oph. (R.) I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him i'the cold ground. My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies; good night, good night.
4541 
4542 [Exit, R.C.]
4543 
4544 King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
4545 
4546 [Exit Horatio, through centre R.]
4547 
4548 O! this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
4549 
4550 All from her father's death.
4551 
4552 O, Gertrude, Gertrude,
4553 
4554 When sorrows come, they come not single spies,
4555 
4556 But in battalions!
4557 
4558 Enter Marcellus R. centre.
4559 
4560 King. What is the matter?
4561 
4562 Mar.
4563 Save yourself, my lord:
4564 
4565 The young Laertes, in a riotous head,16
4566 
4567 O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;
4568 
4569 They cry, Choose we: Laertes shall be king!
4570 
4571 Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds,
4572 
4573 Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!
4574 
4575 [Noise within, R.C.]
4576 
4577 Enter Laertes, armed; Danes following R. centre.
4578 
4579 Laer. Where is this king?—Sirs, stand you all without.
4580 
4581 Dan. No, let's come in.
4582 
4583 80Laer.
4584 I pray you, give me leave.
4585 
4586 Dan. We will, we will.
4587 
4588 [They retire without, R.H.]
4589 
4590 Laer. O, thou vile king,
4591 
4592 Give me my father.
4593 
4594 Queen (Interposing.) Calmly, good Laertes.
4595 
4596 Laer. (R.) That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
4597 
4598 Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
4599 
4600 Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow
4601 
4602 Of my true mother.17
4603 
4604 King. (L.) What is the cause, Laertes,
4605 
4606 That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?
4607 
4608 Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:
4609 
4610 There's such divinity doth hedge a king,18
4611 
4612 That treason can but peep to what it would,
4613 
4614 Acts little of his will.
4615 
4616 Let him go, Gertrude.
4617 
4618 [Queen obeys.]
4619 
4620 Laer. Where is my father?
4621 
4622 King.
4623 Dead.
4624 
4625 Queen.
4626 But not by him.
4627 
4628 King. Let him demand his fill.
4629 
4630 Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
4631 
4632 To hell, allegiance! To this point I stand,
4633 
4634 That both the worlds I give to negligence,19
4635 
4636 Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
4637 
4638 Most throughly for my father.
4639 
4640 King.
4641 Who shall stay you!
4642 
4643 Laer. My will, not all the world's:20
4644 
4645 And, for my means, I'll husband them so well,
4646 
4647 They shall go far with little.
4648 
4649 King.
4650 Good Laertes,
4651 
4652 That I am guiltless of your father's death,
4653 
4654 81
4655 And am most sensible in grief21 for it,
4656 
4657 It shall as level to your judgment 'pear
4658 
4659 As day does to your eye.
4660 
4661 Hor. (Without.) Oh, poor Ophelia!
4662 
4663 King. Let her come in.
4664 
4665 Enter Ophelia (R.C.), fantastically dressed with Straws and Flowers.
4666 
4667 Laer. (Goes up L.C.) O rose of May!
4668 
4669 Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
4670 
4671 O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's wits
4672 
4673 Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
4674 
4675 Oph. (R.C.)
4676 
4677 They bore him barefac'd on the bier;
4678 
4679 And on his grave rain many a tear,—
4680 
4681 Fare you well, my dove!
4682 
4683 Laer. (Coming down R) Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
4684 
4685 It could not move thus.
4686 
4687 Oph. You must sing, Down-a-down,22 an you call him a-down-a. O, how well the wheel becomes it!23 It is the false steward, that stole his master's daughter.
4688 
4689 Laer. This nothing's more than matter.
4690 
4691 Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance;24 pray you, love, remember: and there is pansies,25 that's for thoughts.
4692 
4693 Laer. A document in madness; thoughts and remembrance fitted.
4694 
4695 Oph. There's fennel for you, (crosses to the King on L.H.) and columbines:26 there's rue for you; (turns to the Queen, 82who is R.C.) and here's some for me:—we may call it herb of grace o'Sundays:27—you may wear your rue with a difference.28—There's a daisy:29—I would give you some violets,30 but they withered all when my father died:—They say he made a good end,——
4696 
4697 For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy—31
4698 
4699 Laer. (R.) Thought and affliction,32 passion, hell itself, She turns to favour and to prettiness.
4700 
4701 Oph.
4702 
4703 And will he not come again?
4704 
4705 And will he not come again?
4706 
4707 No, no, he is dead,
4708 
4709 Gone to his death-bed,
4710 
4711 He never will come again.
4712 
4713 His beard was white as snow,
4714 
4715 All flaxen was his poll:
4716 
4717 He is gone, he is gone,
4718 
4719 And we cast away moan:
4720 
4721 Heaven 'a mercy on his soul!
4722 
4723 And of all christian souls, I pray Heaven. Heaven be wi' you.
4724 
4725 [Exit Ophelia, R.C., Queen following.]
4726 
4727 Laer. Do you see this, O Heaven?
4728 
4729 83King. (L.C.) Laertes, I must commune with your grief,33
4730 
4731 Or you deny me right.
4732 
4733 Be you content to lend your patience to us,
4734 
4735 And we shall jointly labour with your soul
4736 
4737 To give it due content.
4738 
4739 Laer. (R.C.)
4740 Let this be so;
4741 
4742 His means of death, his obscure funeral,—
4743 
4744 No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,34
4745 
4746 No noble rite nor formal ostentation,—
4747 
4748 Cry to be heard,35 as 'twere from heaven to earth,
4749 
4750 That I must call't in question.
4751 
4752 King.
4753 So you shall;
4754 
4755 And where the offence is let the great axe fall.36
4756 
4757 How now! what news?
4758 
4759 Enter Bernardo (R.H.C.)
4760 
4761 Ber. (C.)
4762 Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
4763 
4764 This to your majesty; this to the Queen.
4765 
4766 King. From Hamlet! who brought them?
4767 
4768 Ber. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
4769 
4770 King.
4771 Laertes, you shall hear them.—
4772 
4773 Leave us.
4774 [Exit, L.H.C.]
4775 
4776 [Reads.] High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on your kingdom.37 To morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden and more strange return.
4777 
4778 Hamlet.
4779 
4780 What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
4781 
4782 Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
4783 
4784 Laer. (R.) Know you the hand?
4785 
4786 King. (L.) 'Tis Hamlet's character:38 Naked,—
4787 
4788 84
4789 And in a postscript here, he says, alone.
4790 
4791 Can you advise me?
4792 
4793 Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come;
4794 
4795 It warms the very sickness in my heart,
4796 
4797 That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
4798 
4799 Thus diddest thou.
4800 
4801 King.
4802 If it be so, Laertes,
4803 
4804 Will you be rul'd by me?
4805 
4806 Laer.
4807 Ay, my lord;
4808 
4809 So you will not o'er-rule me to a peace.
4810 
4811 King. To thine own peace.
4812 
4813 Some two months since,
4814 
4815 Here was a gentleman of Normandy,
4816 
4817 He made confession of39 you;
4818 
4819 And gave you such a masterly report,
4820 
4821 For art and exercise in your defence,40
4822 
4823 And for your rapier most especially,
4824 
4825 That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,
4826 
4827 If one could match you: this report of his
4828 
4829 Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy,
4830 
4831 That he could nothing do but wish and beg
4832 
4833 Your sudden coming o'er, to play with you.
4834 
4835 Now, out of this,——
4836 
4837 Laer.
4838 What out of this, my lord?
4839 
4840 King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?
4841 
4842 Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
4843 
4844 A face without a heart?
4845 
4846 Laer.
4847 Why ask you this?
4848 
4849 King. Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
4850 
4851 We'll put on those shall praise your excellence,
4852 
4853 And set a double varnish on the fame
4854 
4855 The Frenchman gave you; bring you, in fine, together,
4856 
4857 And wager o'er your heads; he, being remiss,41
4858 
4859 Most generous, and free from all contriving,
4860 
4861 Will not peruse the foils:42 so that, with ease,
4862 
4863 Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
4864 
4865 85
4866 A sword unbated,43 and, in a pass of practice,44
4867 
4868 Requite him for your father.
4869 
4870 Laer.
4871 I will do't:
4872 
4873 And, for the purpose, I'll anoint my sword.
4874 
4875 I bought an unction of a mountebank,
4876 
4877 So mortal, that but dip a knife in it,
4878 
4879 Where it draws blood no cataplasm45 so rare,
4880 
4881 Collected from all simples46 that have virtue
4882 
4883 Under the moon, can save the thing from death
4884 
4885 That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
4886 
4887 With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
4888 
4889 It may be death.
4890 
4891 King. (L.) Let's further think of this;
4892 
4893 We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings,47
4894 
4895 When in your motion48 you are hot and dry,
4896 
4897 (As make your bouts more violent to that end,)
4898 
4899 And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him
4900 
4901 A chalice for the nonce;49 whereon but sipping,
4902 
4903 If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,50
4904 
4905 Our purpose may hold there. But stay, what noise?
4906 
4907 Enter Queen (R.C.)
4908 
4909 Queen. (C.) One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
4910 
4911 So fast they follow: Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
4912 
4913 Laer. (R.) Drown'd! O, where?
4914 
4915 Queen. There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
4916 
4917 That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
4918 
4919 Therewith fantastick garlands did she make
4920 
4921 Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples;51
4922 
4923 86
4924 There, on the pendent boughs her cornet weeds
4925 
4926 Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;
4927 
4928 When down her weedy trophies, and herself,
4929 
4930 Fell in the weeping brook.
4931 
4932 Laer. I forbid my tears: But yet
4933 
4934 It is our trick:52 nature her custom holds,
4935 
4936 Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,
4937 
4938 The woman will be out.53
4939 
4940 Adieu, my lord:
4941 
4942 I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
4943 
4944 But that this folly drowns it.54
4945 
4946 [Exeunt. C.]
4947 
4948 END OF ACT FOURTH.
4949 Notes

4953 
4954 IV.2 In this brainish apprehension,] Distempered, brainsick mood.
4955 
4956 IV.3 Where the offender's scourge is weigh'd, But never the offence.] When an offender is popular, the people never consider what his crime was, but they scrutinise his punishment.
4957 
4958 IV.4 Politick worms] i.e., artful, cunning worms.
4959 
4960 IV.5 The wind at help,] i.e., ready.
4961

4963 
4964 IV.7 Our sovereign process:] i.e., our royal design.
4965 
4966 IV.8 By letters conjuring to that effect,] The verb to conjure, in the sense of to supplicate, was formerly accented on the first syllable.
4967 
4968 IV.9 Howe'er my haps,] Chances of fortune.
4969 
4970 IV.10 His sandal shoon.] Shoon is the old plural of shoe. The verse is descriptive of a pilgrim. While this kind of devotion was in favour, love intrigues were carried on under that mask.
4971 
4972 IV.11 Larded with sweet flowers;] i.e., Garnished with sweet flowers.
4973 
4974 IV.12 Heaven 'ield you.] Requite; yield you recompence.
4975 
4976 IV.13 The owl was a baker's daughter.] This is in reference to a story that was once prevalent among the common people of Gloucestershire.
4977 
4978 IV.14 Conceit upon her father.] Fancies respecting her father.
4979 
4980 IV.15 Don'd and dupp'd] To don, is to do on, or put on, as doff is to do off, or put off. To dupp is to do up, or lift up the latch.
4981 
4982 IV.16 In a riotous head,] The tide, strongly flowing, is said to pour in with a great head.
4983 
4984 IV.17 The chaste unsmirched brow of my true mother.] Unsmirched is unstained, not defiled.
4985 
4986 IV.18 Doth hedge a king,] The word hedge is used by the gravest writers upon the highest subjects.
4987 
4988 IV.19 Both the worlds I give to negligence,] I am careless of my present and future prospects, my views in this life, as well as that which is to come.
4989 
4990 IV.20 My will, not all the world's:] i.e., by my will as far as my will is concerned, not all the world shall stop me; and, as for my means, I'll husband them so well, they shall go far, though really little.
4991 
4992 IV.21 Sensible in grief] Poignantly affected with.
4993 
4994 IV.22 You must sing Down-a-down,] This was the burthen of an old song, well known in Shakespeare's time.
4995 
4996 IV.23 How well the wheel becomes it!] This probably means that the song or charm is well adapted to those who are occupied at spinning at the wheel.
4997 
4998 IV.24 There's rosemary, that's for remembrance;] Rosemary was anciently supposed to strengthen the memory, and was carried at funerals and wore at weddings.

5001 
5002 IV.26 There's fennel for you, and columbines:] Fennel was considered an emblem of flattery, and columbine was anciently supposed to be a thankless flower; signifying probably that the courtiers flattered to get favours, and were thankless after receiving them. Columbine was emblematical of forsaken lovers.
5003 
5004 IV.27 There's rue for you; and here's some for me:—we may call it herb of grace o' Sundays:] Probably a quibble is meant here, as rue anciently signified the same as ruth, i.e., sorrow. In the common dictionaries of Shakespeare's time, it was called herb of grace. Ophelia wishes to remind the Queen of the sorrow and contrition she ought to feel for her unlawful marriage; and that she may wear her rue with peculiar propriety on Sundays, when she solicits pardon for the crime which she has so much occasion to rue and repent of.—Malone.
5005 
5006 IV.28 You may wear your rue with a difference.] i.e., to distinguish it from that worn by Ophelia, herself: because her tears flowed from the loss of a father—those of the Queen ought to flow for her guilt.
5007

5017 
5018 IV.34 No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,] Not only the sword, but the helmet, gauntlet, spurs, and tabard, (i.e., a coat whereon the armorial ensigns were anciently depicted, from whence the term coat of armour), are hung over the grave of every knight.
5019 
5020 IV.35 Cry to be heard,] All these multiplied incitements are things which cry, &c.
5021 
5022 IV.36 Let the great axe fall.] i.e., the axe that is to be laid to the root.
5023 
5024 IV.37 Naked on your kingdom,] i.e., unprovided and defenceless.
5025 
5026 IV.38 'Tis Hamlet's character,] Peculiar mode of shaping his letters.
5027 
5028 IV.39 Made confession of] Acknowledged.

5035 
5036 IV.43 A sword unbated,] Not blunted, as foils are by a button fixed to the end.
5037 
5038 IV.44 In a pass of practice,] This probably means some favourite pass, some trick of fencing, with which Hamlet was inexperienced, and by which Laertes may be sure of success.
5039 
5040 IV.45 No cataplasm,] i.e., poultice—a healing application.
5041

5055 
5056 IV.53
5057 
5058 When these are gone,
5059 
5060 The woman will be out.
5061 
5062 When these tears are shed, this womanish passion will be over.
5063 
5064 IV.54 But that this folly drowns it.] i.e., my rage had flamed, if this flood of tears had not extinguished it.
5065

5067 
5068 ACT V.
5069 Scene I.—A CHURCH YARD.
5070 Enter two Clowns,1 with spades, &c. (L.H.U.E.)
5071 
5072 1st Clo. (R.) Is she to be buried in christian burial that wilfully seeks her own salvation?
5073 
5074 2nd Clo. (L.) I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight:2 the crowner3 hath set on her, and finds it christian burial.
5075 
5076 1st Clo. How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence?
5077 
5078 2nd Clo. Why, 'tis found so.
5079 
5080 1st Clo. It must be se offendendo;4 it cannot be else. For here lies the point: If I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and an act hath three branches; it is, to act, to do, and to perform:5 argal,6 she drowned herself wittingly.
5081 
5082 2nd Clo. Nay, but hear you, goodman delver.7
5083 
5084 1st Clo. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here stands the man; good: If the man go to this water, and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he goes,8 mark 88you that; but if the water come to him and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
5085 
5086 2nd Clo. But is this law?
5087 
5088 1st Clo. Ay, marry is't; crowner's-quest law.9
5089 
5090 2nd Clo. Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out of christian burial.
5091 
5092 1st Clo. Why, there thou say'st:10 And the more pity that great folks should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves, more than their even christian.11 Come, my spade. There is no ancient gentlemen but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers: they hold up Adam's profession.
5093 
5094 2nd Clo. Was he a gentleman?12
5095 
5096 1st Clo. He was the first that ever bore arms. I'll put another question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the purpose, confess thyself——13
5097 
5098 2nd Clo. Go to.
5099 
5100 1st Clo. What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?
5101 
5102 2nd Clo. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.
5103 
5104 1st Clo. I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows does well; But how does it well? it does well to those that do ill: now, thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church: argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.
5105 
5106 2nd Clo. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?
5107 
5108 891st Clo. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.14
5109 
5110 2nd Clo. Marry, now I can tell.
5111 
5112 1st Clo. To't.
5113 
5114 2nd Clo. Mass, I cannot tell.
5115 
5116 1st Clo. Cudgel thy brains no more about it,15 for your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when you are asked this question next, say, a grave-maker, the houses that he makes, last till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan, and fetch me a stoup of liquor.16
5117 
5118 [Exit 2nd Clown, L.H.U.E.]
5119 
5120 Enter Hamlet and Horatio (L.H.U.E.)
5121 
5122 First Clown digs and sings.
5123 
5124 In youth, when I did love, did love,17
5125 
5126 Methought, it was very sweet,
5127 
5128 To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove
5129 
5130 O, methought, there was nothing meet.
5131 
5132 Ham. (Behind the grave.) Has this fellow no feeling of his business, he sings at grave-making?
5133 
5134 Hor. (On Hamlet's R.) Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
5135 
5136 Ham. 'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense.18
5137 
5138 1st Clo.
5139 But age, with his stealing steps,
5140 
5141 Hath clawed me in his clutch,
5142 
5143 And hath shipped me into the land,
5144 
5145 As if I had never been such.
5146 
5147 [Throws up a skull.]
5148 
5149 Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing 90once: How the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! This might be the pate of a politician, which this ass now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent Heaven, might it not?
5150 
5151 Hor. It might, my lord.
5152 
5153 [Gravedigger throws up bones.]
5154 
5155 Ham. Did these bones cost no more the breeding, but to play at loggats with them?19 mine ache to think on't.
5156 
5157 1st Clo.
5158 [Sings.]
5159 
5160 A pick-axe and a spade, a spade,
5161 
5162 For and a shrouding sheet:20
5163 
5164 O, a pit of clay for to be made
5165 
5166 For such a guest is meet.
5167 
5168 [Throws up a skull.]
5169 
5170 Ham. There's another: Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer? Where be his quiddits now, his quillets,21 his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce22 with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of his action of battery? I will speak to this fellow.—Whose grave's this, sirrah?
5171 
5172 1st Clo. Mine, sir.—
5173 
5174 [Sings.]
5175 
5176 O, a pit of clay for to be made
5177 
5178 For such a guest is meet.
5179 
5180 Ham. (R. of grave.) I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't.
5181 
5182 1st Clo. You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is not yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
5183 
5184 Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't, and say it is thine: 'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
5185 
5186 1st. Clo. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again, from me to you.
5187 
5188 91Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
5189 
5190 1st Clo. For no man, sir.
5191 
5192 Ham. What woman, then?
5193 
5194 1st Clo. For none, neither.
5195 
5196 Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
5197 
5198 1st Clo. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.
5199 
5200 Ham. How absolute the knave is!23 we must speak by the card,24 or equivocation will undo us, [To Horatio, R.] How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
5201 
5202 1st Clo. Of all the days i'the year, I came to't that day that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
5203 
5204 Ham. How long's that since?
5205 
5206 1st Clo. Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: It was the very day that young Hamlet was born,25 he that is mad, and sent into England.
5207 
5208 Ham. Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
5209 
5210 1st Clo. Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits there; or, if he do not, 'tis no great matter there.
5211 
5212 Ham. Why?
5213 
5214 1st Clo. 'Twill not be seen in him there; there the men are as mad as he.
5215 
5216 Ham. How came he mad?
5217 
5218 1st Clo. Very strangely, they say.
5219 
5220 Ham. How strangely?
5221 
5222 1st Clo. 'Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
5223 
5224 Ham. Upon what ground?
5225 
5226 1st Clo. Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty years.
5227 
5228 Ham. How long will a man lie i'the earth ere he rot?
5229 
5230 1st Clo. 'Faith, if he be not rotten before he die, he 92will last you some eight year or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.
5231 
5232 Ham. Why he more than another?
5233 
5234 1st Clo. Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that he will keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore decayer of your ill-begotten dead body. Here's a skull now, hath lain in the earth three-and-twenty years.
5235 
5236 Ham. Whose was it?
5237 
5238 1st Clo. O, a mad fellow's it was: Whose do you think it was?
5239 
5240 Ham. Nay, I know not.
5241 
5242 1st Clo. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! he poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.
5243 
5244 Ham. This?
5245 [Takes the skull.]
5246 
5247 1st Clo. E'en that.
5248 
5249 Ham. Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath borne me on his back a thousand times. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft; and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is! Where be your gibes now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning? Quite chap-fallen? Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this favour26 she must come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing.
5250 
5251 Hor. What's that, my lord?
5252 
5253 Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o'this fashion i'the earth?
5254 
5255 Hor. E'en so.
5256 
5257 Ham. And smelt so? pah!
5258 
5259 [Gives the skull to Horatio, who returns it to the grave-digger.]
5260 
5261 Hor. E'en so, my lord.
5262 
5263 Ham. To what base uses may we return, Horatio! Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander, till it find it stopping a bung-hole?
5264 
5265 93Hor. 'Twere to consider too curiously,27 to consider so.
5266 
5267 Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: As thus; Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth to dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make loam; And why of that loam, whereto he was converted, might they not stop a beer barrel?
5268 
5269 Imperial Cæsar,28 dead and turn'd to clay,
5270 
5271 Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:
5272 
5273 O, that the earth, which kept the world in awe,
5274 
5275 Should patch a wall to expel the winter's flaw!29
5276 
5277 But soft! but soft! aside: Here comes the king,
5278 
5279 The queen, the courtiers: Who is this they follow?
5280 
5281 And with such maimèd rites?30 This doth betoken
5282 
5283 The corse they follow did with desperate hand
5284 
5285 Fordo its own life:31 'Twas of some estate.32
5286 
5287 Couch we awhile, and mark.
5288 
5289 [Retiring with Horatio, R.H.]
5290 
5291 Enter Priests, &c., in procession; the corpse of Ophelia, Laertes and Mourners following; King, Queen, their Trains, &c.
5292 
5293 Laer. (L. of the grave.) What ceremony else?
5294 
5295 Ham. (R.)
5296 That is Laertes,
5297 
5298 A very noble youth.
5299 
5300 1st Priest. (R. of the grave.) Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
5301 
5302 As we have warranty: Her death was doubtful;
5303 
5304 And, but that great command o'ersways the order,33
5305 
5306 She should in ground unsanctified have lodged
5307 
5308 Till the last trumpet; for charitable prayers,
5309 
5310 Shards,34 flints, and pebbles, should be thrown on her:
5311 
5312 94
5313 Yet here she is allowed her virgin crants,35
5314 
5315 Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
5316 
5317 Of bell and burial.36
5318 
5319 Laer. Must there no more be done?
5320 
5321 1st Priest.
5322 No more be done:
5323 
5324 We should profane the service of the dead
5325 
5326 To sing a requiem,37 and such rest to her
5327 
5328 As to peace-parted souls.
5329 
5330 Laer. O, from her fair and unpolluted flesh
5331 
5332 May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,38
5333 
5334 A ministering angel shall my sister be,
5335 
5336 When thou liest howling.
5337 
5338 Ham.
5339 What, the fair Ophelia!
5340 
5341 Queen. (Behind the grave, C. with the King.)
5342 
5343 Sweets to the sweet: Farewell!
5344 
5345 [Scattering flowers.]
5346 
5347 I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
5348 
5349 I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
5350 
5351 And not have strew'd thy grave.
5352 
5353 Laer.
5354 O, treble woe
5355 
5356 Fall ten times treble on that cursed head,
5357 
5358 Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense39
5359 
5360 Depriv'd thee of!—Hold off the earth a while,
5361 
5362 Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:
5363 
5364 [Leaps into the grave.]
5365 
5366 Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
5367 
5368 Till of this flat a mountain you have made,
5369 
5370 To o'ertop old Pelion,40 or the skyish head
5371 
5372 Of blue Olympus.
5373 
5374 Ham. (Advancing.) What is he whose grief
5375 
5376 Bears such an emphasis?—whose phrase of sorrow
5377 
5378 95
5379 Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand
5380 
5381 Like wonder-wounded hearers?—this is I,
5382 
5383 Hamlet the Dane.
5384 
5385 Laer. (L., leaping from the grave.) The devil take thy soul!
5386 
5387 [Grappling with him.]
5388 
5389 Ham. (R.C.) Thou pray'st not well.
5390 
5391 I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;
5392 
5393 For, though I am not splenetive and rash,
5394 
5395 Yet have I in me something dangerous,
5396 
5397 Which let thy wisdom fear: Hold off thy hand!
5398 
5399 King. Pluck them asunder.
5400 
5401 Queen. (C.)
5402 Hamlet, Hamlet!
5403 
5404 Ham. (R.C.) Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
5405 
5406 Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
5407 
5408 Queen. O my son, what theme?
5409 
5410 Ham. I lov'd Ophelia: forty thousand brothers
5411 
5412 Could not, with all their quantity of love,
5413 
5414 Make up my sum.—What wilt thou do for her?
5415 
5416 Queen. O, he is mad, Laertes.
5417 
5418 Ham. Come, show me what thou'lt do:
5419 
5420 Wou'lt weep? wou'lt fight? wou'lt fast? wou'lt tear thyself?
5421 
5422 I'll do't.—Dost thou come here to whine?
5423 
5424 To outface me41 with leaping in her grave?
5425 
5426 Be buried quick with her, and so will I:
5427 
5428 And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
5429 
5430 Millions of acres on us, till our ground,42
5431 
5432 Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
5433 
5434 Make Ossa43 like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
5435 
5436 I'll rant as well as thou.
5437 
5438 Queen.
5439 This is mere madness:
5440 
5441 And thus a while the fit will work on him;
5442 
5443 Anon, as patient as the female dove,
5444 
5445 When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,44
5446 
5447 His silence will sit drooping.
5448 
5449 96Ham.
5450 Hear you, sir;
5451 
5452 What is the reason that you use me thus?
5453 
5454 I lov'd you ever: But it is no matter;
5455 
5456 Let Hercules himself do what he may,
5457 
5458 The cat will mew,45 and dog will have his day.
5459 
5460 [Exit, R.H.]
5461 
5462 King. (C.) I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
5463 
5464 [Exit Horatio, R.H.]
5465 
5466 Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son,
5467 
5468 [Exit Queen, attended, R.H.]
5469 
5470 Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;46
5471 
5472 [To Laertes.]
5473 
5474 We'll put the matter to the present push.—
5475 
5476 This grave shall have a living monument:47
5477 
5478 An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
5479 
5480 Till then, in patience our proceeding be.
5481 
5482 [The characters group round the grave.]
5483 
5484 Scene II.—HALL IN THE CASTLE.
5485 Enter Hamlet and Horatio (R.H.)
5486 
5487 Ham. But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
5488 
5489 That to Laertes I forgot myself;
5490 
5491 For by the image of my cause,48 I see
5492 
5493 The portraiture of his.
5494 
5495 Hor.
5496 Peace! who comes here?
5497 
5498 Enter Osric (L.H.)
5499 
5500 Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
5501 
5502 97Ham. (C.) I humbly thank you, sir.—Dost know this water-fly?49
5503 
5504 Hor. (R.) No, my good lord.
5505 
5506 Ham. Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to know him.
5507 
5508 Osr. (L.) Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart a thing to you from his majesty.
5509 
5510 Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit.50 Your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.
5511 
5512 Osr. I thank your lordship, 'tis very hot.
5513 
5514 Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
5515 
5516 Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
5517 
5518 Ham. But yet, methinks it is very sultry and hot,51 for my complexion,—
5519 
5520 Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere,—I cannot tell how.—But, my lord, his majesty bade me signify to you, that he has laid a great wager on your head: Sir, this is the matter,—
5521 
5522 Ham. I beseech you, remember——
5523 
5524 [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]
5525 
5526 Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.52 Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and great showing:53 Indeed, to speak feelingly of him,54 he is the card or calendar of gentry,55 98for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see.56
5527 
5528 Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman?57
5529 
5530 Osr. Of Laertes?
5531 
5532 Ham. Of him, sir.
5533 
5534 Osr. Sir, you are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is—
5535 
5536 Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to know himself.58
5537 
5538 Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon.
5539 
5540 Ham. What is his weapon?
5541 
5542 Osr. Rapier and dagger.
5543 
5544 Ham. That's two of his weapons: but, well.
5545 
5546 Osr. The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary horses: against the which he has imponed,59 as I take it, six French rapiers and poignards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers,60 or so: Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit.61
5547 
5548 Ham. What call you the carriages?
5549 
5550 Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
5551 
5552 99Ham. The phrase would be more german62 to the matter, if we could carry cannon by our sides.
5553 
5554 Osr. The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; and it would come to immediate trial, if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.63
5555 
5556 Ham. How if I answer no?64
5557 
5558 Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
5559 
5560 Ham. Sir, it is the breathing time of day with me; let the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose, I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.
5561 
5562 Osr. Shall I deliver you so?
5563 
5564 Ham. To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.
5565 
5566 Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.
5567 
5568 [Exit, L.H.]
5569 
5570 Hor. (R.) You will lose this wager, my lord.
5571 
5572 Ham. (C.) I do not think so; since he went into France, I have been in continual practice; I shall win at the odds.65 But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here about my heart: but it is no matter.
5573 
5574 Hor. Nay, good my lord.
5575 
5576 Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving,66 as would, perhaps, trouble a woman.
5577 
5578 Hor. If your mind dislike any thing, obey it:67 I will forestall their repair hither, and say, you are not fit.
5579 
5580 Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury: there is a special providence in the fall of a sparrow.
5581 
5582 [Exeunt, L.H.]
5583

5585 
5586 Scene III.—ROOM IN THE CASTLE.
5587 King and Queen, on a dais, Laertes (R.), Lords (R.), Ladies (L.), Osric (R.) and Attendants, with Foils, &c., discovered (R.H.); Tables (R. and L.)—Flourish of Trumpets.
5588 
5589 Enter Hamlet and Horatio (L.H.)
5590 
5591 King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
5592 
5593 Ham. (offering his hand to Laertes)
5594 
5595 Give me your pardon, sir: I have done you wrong;
5596 
5597 But pardon it, as you are a gentleman.
5598 
5599 Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
5600 
5601 Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,
5602 
5603 That I have shot my arrow o'er the house,
5604 
5605 And hurt my brother.
5606 
5607 Laer. (R.)
5608 I am satisfied in nature,
5609 
5610 Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
5611 
5612 To my revenge.
5613 
5614 I do receive your offer'd love like love,
5615 
5616 And will not wrong it.
5617 
5618 Ham.
5619 I embrace it freely:
5620 
5621 And will this brother's wager frankly play.
5622 
5623 Give us the foils.
5624 
5625 Laer.
5626 Come, one for me.
5627 
5628 Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance
5629 
5630 Your skill shall, like a star i'the darkest night,
5631 
5632 Stick fiery off indeed.68
5633 
5634 Laer.
5635 You mock me, sir.
5636 
5637 Ham. No, by this hand.
5638 
5639 King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
5640 
5641 You know the wager?
5642 
5643 Ham.
5644 Very well, my lord;
5645 
5646 Your grace hath laid the odds o'the weaker side.
5647 
5648 King. I do not fear it; I have seen you both:
5649 
5650 But since he's better'd,69 we have therefore odds.
5651 
5652 101Laer. This is too heavy, let me see another.
5653 
5654 Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
5655 
5656 Osr. Ay, my good lord.
5657 
5658 King. Set me the stoups of wine70 upon that table.—
5659 
5660 [Pages exeunt R. and L.]
5661 
5662 If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
5663 
5664 Or quit71 in answer to the third exchange,
5665 
5666 Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
5667 
5668 The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
5669 
5670 And in the cup an union shall he throw,72
5671 
5672 Richer than that which four successive kings
5673 
5674 In Denmark's crown have worn.
5675 
5676 Pages return with wine.
5677 
5678 Give me the cup;
5679 
5680 And let the kettle73 to the trumpet speak,
5681 
5682 The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
5683 
5684 The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
5685 
5686 Now the king drinks to Hamlet.—Come, begin;
5687 
5688 And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.
5689 
5690 Ham. Come on, sir.
5691 
5692 Laer.
5693 Come, my lord.
5694 
5695 [They play.]
5696 
5697 Ham.
5698 One.
5699 
5700 Laer.
5701 No.
5702 
5703 Ham.
5704 Judgment.
5705 
5706 Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
5707 
5708 Laer.
5709 Well:—again.
5710 
5711 King. Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
5712 
5713 [Drops poison into the goblet.]
5714 
5715 Here's to thy health.
5716 
5717 [Pretends to drink.]
5718 
5719 [Trumpets sound; and cannon shot off within.]
5720 
5721 Give him the cup.
5722 
5723 102Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
5724 
5725 [Page places the goblet on table, L.]
5726 
5727 Come.
5728 
5729 Another hit; What say you?
5730 
5731 [They play.]
5732 
5733 Laer. A touch, a touch, I do confess.
5734 
5735 King. Our son shall win.
5736 
5737 Queen. The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.74
5738 
5739 Ham. Good madam!——
5740 
5741 [Trumpets sound.]
5742 
5743 King.
5744 Gertrude, do not drink.
5745 
5746 Queen. I have, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.
5747 
5748 King. It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
5749 
5750 [Aside.]
5751 
5752 Laer. I'll hit him now
5753 
5754 And yet it is almost against my conscience.
5755 
5756 [Aside.]
5757 
5758 Ham. Come, for the third, Laertes: You do but dally;
5759 
5760 I pray you, pass with your best violence;
5761 
5762 I am afeard you make a wanton of me.75
5763 
5764 Laer. Say you so? come on.
5765 
5766 [They play.]
5767 
5768 [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then, in scuffling they change Rapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes.]
5769 
5770 King.
5771 Part them; they are incensed.
5772 
5773 Ham. Nay, come, again.
5774 
5775 [The Queen falls back in her chair.]
5776 
5777 Osr. (Supporting Laertes, R.) Look to the queen there, ho!
5778 
5779 Hor. (Supporting Hamlet, L.) How is it, my lord?
5780 
5781 Osr. How is't, Laertes?
5782 
5783 Laer. Why, as a woodcock to my own springe,76 Osric;
5784 
5785 I am justly killed with mine own treachery.
5786 
5787 Ham. How does the queen?
5788 
5789 King.
5790 She swoons to see them bleed.
5791 
5792 Queen. No, no, the drink, the drink,—O, my dear Hamlet,—
5793 
5794 The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.
5795 
5796 [The Queen is conveyed off the stage by her attendant Ladies, in a dying state, L.H.U.E.]
5797 
5798 103Ham. O villainy! Ho! let the doors be lock'd:
5799 
5800 Treachery! seek it out.
5801 
5802 [Laertes falls.]
5803 
5804 Laer. (R.) It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
5805 
5806 No medicine in the world can do thee good,
5807 
5808 In thee there is not half an hour's life;
5809 
5810 The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
5811 
5812 Unbated and envenom'd:77 the foul practice78
5813 
5814 Hath turn'd itself on me; lo, here I lie,
5815 
5816 Never to rise again: Thy mother's poison'd:
5817 
5818 I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.
5819 
5820 Ham. The point
5821 
5822 Envenom'd too! Then, venom, to thy work.
5823 
5824 Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damnèd Dane,
5825 
5826 Follow my mother.
5827 
5828 [Stabs the King, who is borne away by his attendants, mortally wounded, R.H.U.E.]
5829 
5830 Laer.
5831 He is justly serv'd;
5832 
5833 Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:
5834 
5835 Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
5836 
5837 Nor thine on me!
5838 
5839 [Dies.]
5840 
5841 Ham. (C.) Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
5842 
5843 You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
5844 
5845 That are but mutes or audience to this act,
5846 
5847 Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, death,79
5848 
5849 Is strict in his arrest), O, I could tell you,—
5850 
5851 But let it be. Horatio,
5852 
5853 Report me and my cause aright
5854 
5855 To the unsatisfied.
5856 
5857 Hor. (L.)
5858 Never believe it:
5859 
5860 I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:
5861 
5862 Here's yet some liquor left.
5863 
5864 [Seizing the goblet on table, L.]
5865 
5866 Ham.
5867 As thou'rt a man,—
5868 
5869 Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have it.
5870 
5871 [Dashes the goblet away.]
5872 
5873 O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
5874 
5875 104
5876 Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!80
5877 
5878 If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
5879 
5880 Absènt thee from felicity awhile,
5881 
5882 And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
5883 
5884 To tell my story.—
5885 
5886 O, I die, Horatio;
5887 
5888 The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit;81
5889 
5890 The rest is silence.
5891 
5892 [Dies, C., Osric on his R., and Horatio on his L.]
5893 
5894 Dead March afar off.
5895 
5896 Curtain slowly descends.
5897 
5898 THE END.
