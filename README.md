## First Deliverable Instructions:
This project is part of a group submission. Grader may refer to any of Dylan Finkbeiner, Kathyrn Ricci or my code.  
Our development git repo: https://github.com/dylanfinkbeiner/532-mapreduce

To run project:
-Ensure machine can run ant commands to build the jar file:  
  >sudo apt-get install ant

-Then execute the bash script:  
  >./execute_tests.sh

Note: The presence of %*% as a separator is a conscious design choice until we can find a way to format better.

Note: If build path is incomplete, please add JRE library to the build_path.xml. We have shipped the MR library only with the externalsort library it uses and have left it to the user to run any instance of JRE over version 8 as they so please.  

## Second Deliverable Instructions:
Same as before. Run bash script:
  >./execute_tests.sh
