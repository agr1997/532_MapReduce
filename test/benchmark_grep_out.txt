(189%&%[Horatio crosses in front of the Ghost to R. Ghost crosses to L.])
(261%&%Enter the King and Queen, preceded by Polonius, Hamlet, Laertes23, Lords, Ladies, and Attendants.)
(311%&%Pol. (R.) He hath, my lord, (wrung from me my slow leave)
(325%&%Ham. (L.) A little more than kin, and less than kind.31)
(329%&%13King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?)
(331%&%Ham. Not so, my lord; I am too much i'the sun.32)
(419%&%[Trumpet March repeated. Exeunt King and Queen, preceded by Polonius, Lords, Ladies, Laertes, and Attendants, R.H.])
(483%&%Ham. Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:52)
(493%&%16Ham. (C.) I am very glad to see you; good even, sir.)
(540%&%Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all,)

(712%&%And bid me hold my peace. [Crosses to L.] I pray you all,)
(828%&%Look thou charácter.73 Give thy thoughts no tongue, any unproportion'd thought74 his act.)
(922%&%Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think.)
(936%&%Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.)
(974%&%Hor. (R.C.) Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season,)
(982%&%Ham. (L.C.) The king doth wake to-night,87 and takes his rouse,88)
(1080%&%Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,96)
(1117%&%By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me:—99)
(1121%&%[Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet, L.H., followed at a distance by Horatio and Marcellus.])
(1126%&%Ham. (R.) Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak; I'll go no further.)
(1195%&%Ham. Haste me to know it, that I, with wings as swift)

(1378%&%Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave)
(1440%&%[Horatio and Marcellus place each their right hand on Hamlet's sword.])
(1468%&%As, Well, we know; or, We could, an if we would; or, If)
(1509%&%I.1 me:] i.e., me who am already on the watch, and have a right to demand the watch-word.)
(1515%&%I.4 The rivals of my watch,] Rivals, for partners or associates.)
(1517%&%I.5 And liegemen to the Dane.] i.e., owing allegiance to Denmark.)
(1521%&%I.7 To watch the minutes of this night;] This seems to have been an expression common in Shakespeare's time.)
(1523%&%I.8 Approve our eyes,] To approve, in Shakespeare's age, signified to make good or establish.)
(1525%&%I.9 What we have seen.] We must here supply "with," or "by relating" before "what we have seen.")
(1527%&%I.10 It harrows me with fear and wonder.] i.e., it confounds and overwhelms me.)
(1529%&%I.11 Usurp'st this time of night,] i.e., abuses, uses against right, and the order of things.)
(1531%&%I.12 I might not this believe, &c.] I could not: it had not been permitted me, &c., without the full and perfect evidence, &c.)
(1533%&%I.13 Jump at this dead hour,] Jump and just were synonymous in Shakespeare's time.)
(1535%&%I.14 In what particular thought to work,] In what particular course to set my thoughts at work: in what particular train to direct the mind and exercise it in conjecture.)
(1537%&%I.15 Gross and scope] Upon the whole, and in a general view.)
(1539%&%I.16 Bodes some strange eruption to our state,] i.e., some political distemper, which will break out in dangerous consequences.)
(1541%&%I.17 Palmy state] Outspread, flourishing. Palm branches were the emblem of victory.)
(1551%&%So in Decker's Knight's Conjuring, &c. "If any of them had bound the spirit of gold by any charmes in cares, or in iron fetters, under the ground, they should, for their own soule's quiet (which, questionless, else would whine up and down,) not for the good of their children, release it.")
(1559%&%Apparitions were supposed to fly from the crowing of the cock, because it indicated the approach of day.)
(1563%&%I.22 The extravagant and erring spirit] Extravagant is, got out of his bounds. Erring is here used in the sense of wandering.)
(1565%&%I.23 Laertes is unknown in the original story, being an introduction of Shakespeare's.)
(1571%&%I.26 With a defeated joy,] i.e., with joy baffled; with joy interrupted by grief.)
(1575%&%I.28 Your leave and favour] The favour of your leave granted, the kind permission. Two substantives with a copulative being here, as is the frequent practice of our author, used for an adjective and substantive: an adjective sense is given to a substantive.)
(1577%&%I.29 Upon his will I sealed my hard consent:] At or upon his earnest and importunate suit, I gave my full and final, though hardly obtained and reluctant, consent.)
(1585%&%Catch the auspicious moment! be time thine own! and may the exercise of thy fairest virtue fill up those hours, that are wholly at your command!)
(1587%&%I.31 A little more than kin, and less than kind.] Dr. Johnson says that kind is the Teutonic word for child. Hamlet, therefore, answers to the titles of cousin and son, which the king had given him, that he was somewhat more than cousin, and less than son. Steevens remarks, that it seems to have been another proverbial phrase: "The nearer we are in blood, the further we must be from love; the greater the kindred is, the less the kindness must be." Kin is still used in the Midland Counties for cousin, and kind signifies nature. Hamlet may, therefore, mean that the relationship between them had become unnatural.)
(1589%&%I.32 I am too much i'the sun.] Meaning, probably, his being sent for from his studies to be exposed at his uncle's marriage as his chiefest courtier, and being thereby placed too much in the radiance of the king's presence; or, perhaps, an allusion to the proverb, "Out of Heaven's blessing, into the warm sun:" but it is not unlikely that a quibble is meant between son and sun.)
(1599%&%I.37 That father lost, lost his;] "That lost father (of your father, i.e., your grandfather), or father so lost, lost his.")
(1601%&%I.38 Do obsequious sorrow:] Follow with becoming and ceremonious observance the memory of the deceased.)
(1603%&%I.39 But to perséver] This word was anciently accented on the second syllable.)
(1611%&%I.43 Sits smiling to my heart:] To is at: gladdens my heart.)
(1613%&%I.44 In grace whereof,] i.e., respectful regard or honour of which.)
(1615%&%I.45 No jocund health, that Denmark drinks to-day,] Dr. Johnson remarks, that the king's intemperance is very strongly impressed; everything that happens to him gives him occasion to drink. The Danes were supposed to be hard drinkers.)
(1617%&%I.46 Resolve itself] To resolve is an old word signifying to dissolve.)
(1621%&%I.48 The uses of this world!] i.e., the habitudes and usages of life.)
(1625%&%I.50 Hyperion to a satyr:] An allusion to the exquisite beauty of Apollo, compared with the deformity of a satyr; that satyr, perhaps, being Pan, the brother of Apollo. Our great poet is here guilty of a false quantity, by calling Hypĕrīon, Hypērĭon, a mistake not unusual among our English poets.)
(1629%&%I.52 I'll change that name with you.] i.e., do not call yourself my servant, you are my friend; so I shall call you, and so I would have you call me.)
(1633%&%I.54 But what make you] What is your object? What are you doing?)
(1635%&%I.55 What, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?] In Shakespeare's time there was a university at Wittenberg; but as it was not founded till 1502, it consequently did not exist in the time to which this play refers.)
(1637%&%I.56 My dearest foe] i.e., my direst or most important foe. This epithet was commonly used to denote the strongest and liveliest interest in any thing or person, for or against.)
(1647%&%i.e., suppress your astonishment for a short time, that you may be the better able to give your attention to what we will relate.)
(1649%&%I.59 In the dead waste and middle of the night,] i.e., in the dark and desolate vast, or vacant space and middle of the night. It was supposed that spirits had permission to range the earth by night alone.)
(1651%&%I.60 With the act of fear,] i.e., by the influence or power of fear.)
(1657%&%I.63 He wore his beaver up.] That part of the helmet which may be lifted up, to take breath the more freely.)
(1665%&%I.67 Pérfume and suppliance of a minute.] i.e., an amusement to fill up a vacant moment, and render it agreeable.)
(1667%&%I.68 Keep within the rear of your affection,] Front not the peril; withdraw or check every warm emotion: advance not so far as your affection would lead you.])
(1671%&%I.70 Puff'd and reckless libertine.] Bloated and swollen, the effect of excess; and heedless and indifferent to consequences.)
(1673%&%I.71 Recks not his own read.] i.e., heeds not his own lessons or counsel.)
(1677%&%I.73 Look thou charácter.] i.e., a word often used by Shakespeare to signify to write, strongly infix; the accent is on the second syllable.)
(1687%&%I.78 Season this in thee!] i.e., infix it in such a manner as that it may never wear out.)
(1689%&%I.79 Yourself shall keep the key of it.] Thence it shall not be dismissed, till you think it needless to retain it.)
(1691%&%I.80 Given private time to you;] Spent his time in private visits to you.)
(1693%&%I.81 As so 'tis put on me,] Suggested to, impressed on me.)
(1703%&%i.e., inexperienced girl. Unsifted means one who has not nicely canvassed and examined the peril of her situation.)
(1707%&%I.85 Slander any leisure moment,] i.e., I would not have you so disgrace your most idle moments, as not to find better employment for them than lord Hamlet's conversation.)
(1709%&%I.86 An eager air.] Eager here means sharp, from aigre, French.)
(1715%&%I.89 Questionable shape,] To question, in our author's time, signified to converse. Questionable, therefore, means capable of being conversed with.)
(1719%&%I.91 Cerements;] Those precautions usually adopted in preparing dead bodies for sepulture.)
(1727%&%I.95 At a pin's fee;] i.e., the value of a pin.)
(1729%&%I.96 What if it tempt you toward the flood, &c.] Malignant spirits were supposed to entice their victims into places of gloom and peril, and exciting in them the deepest terror.)
(1731%&%I.97 Beetles o'er his base into the sea,] i.e., projects darkly over the sea.)
(1733%&%I.98 Némean lion's nerve.] Shakespeare, and nearly all the poets of his time, disregarded the quantity of Latin names. The poet has here placed the accent on the first syllable, instead of the second.)
(1735%&%I.99 That lets me:] To let, in the sense in which it is here used, means to hinder—to obstruct—to oppose. The word is derived from the Saxon.)
(1737%&%I.100 To fast in fires,] Chaucer has a similar passage with regard to eternal punishment—"And moreover the misery of Hell shall be in default of meat and drink.")
(1741%&%I.102 Hair to stand on end,] A common image of that day. "Standing as frighted with erected haire.")
(1743%&%I.103 The fretful porcupine:] This animal being considered irascible and timid.)
(1747%&%I.105 Rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,] i.e., in indolence and sluggishness, by its torpid habits contributes to that morbid state of its juices which may figuratively be denominated rottenness.)
(1757%&%I.110 Hebenon] Hebenon is described by Nares in his Glossary, as the juice of ebony, supposed to be a deadly poison.)
(1761%&%I.112 Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd;] To housel is to minister the sacrament to one lying on his death bed. Disappointed is the same as unappointed, which here means unprepared. Unanel'd is without extreme unction.)
(1765%&%I.114 Pale his uneffectual fire:] i.e., not seen by the light of day; or it may mean, shining without heat.)
(1767%&%I.115 In this distracted globe.] i.e., his head distracted with thought.)
(1771%&%I.117 Come, bird, come.] This is the call which falconers used to their hawk in the air when they would have him come down to them.)
(1773%&%I.118 There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark— But he's an arrant knave.] Hamlet probably begins these words in the ardour of confidence and sincerity; but suddenly alarmed at the magnitude of the disclosure he was going to make, and considering that, not his friend Horatio only, but another person was present, he breaks off suddenly:—"There's ne'er a villain in all Denmark that can match (perhaps he would have said) my uncle in villainy; but recollecting the danger of such a declaration, he pauses for a moment, and then abruptly concludes:—"but he's an arrant knave.")
(1775%&%I.119 Whirling words,] Random words thrown out with no specific aim.)
(1777%&%I.120 By Saint Patrick,] At this time all the whole northern world had their learning from Ireland; to which place it had retired, and there flourished under the auspices of this Saint.)
(1781%&%I.122 Give it welcome.] Receive it courteously, as you would a stranger when introduced.)
(1783%&%I.123 Antick disposition] i.e., strange, foreign to my nature, a disposition which Hamlet assumes as a protection against the danger which he apprehends from his uncle, and as a cloak for the concealment of his own meditated designs.)
(1787%&%I.125 Friending to you—shall not lack] Disposition to serve you shall not be wanting.)
(1797%&%Oph. O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!)
(1821%&%Oph. He took me by the wrist, and held me hard;)
(1850%&%Pol. Come, go with me; I will go seek the king.)
(1944%&%Pol. Now do I think (or else this brain of mine)
(1952%&%King. (C.) O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.)
(2003%&%[Reads] To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified Ophelia,—12)
(2005%&%That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase, beautified is a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:)
(2023%&%O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;15 I have not art to reckon my groans: but that I love thee best, O most best,16 believe it. Adieu.)
(2025%&%Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,17 Hamlet.)
(2044%&%Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,)
(2090%&%Pol. Hath there been such a time (I'd fain know that,))
(2119%&%Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:)
(2156%&%Ham. Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten thousand.)
(2160%&%Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god, kissing carrion,——Have you a daughter?27)
(2164%&%Ham. Let her not walk i'the sun: conception is a blessing; but as your daughter may conceive,—friend, look to't, look to't, look to't.)
(2168%&%Pol. (Aside.) Still harping on my daughter:—yet he knew me not at first; he said I was a fishmonger. [Crosses to L.] I'll speak to him again.—What do you read, my lord?)
(2178%&%Ham. Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue28 says here that old men have grey beards; that their faces are 39wrinkled; their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams: All of which, sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down; for yourself, sir, shall be as old as I am, if, like a crab, you could go backward.)
(2182%&%Pol. (Aside.) Though this be madness, yet there's method in it. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?)
(2187%&%Pol. (L.) Indeed, that is out o' the air.—How pregnant sometimes his replies29 are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter.—My honourable lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.)
(2189%&%Ham. (C.) You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will more willingly part withall, except my life, except my life, except my life.)
(2196%&%Pol. (Without.) You go to seek the lord Hamlet; there he is.)
(2206%&%Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? [Crosses to Rosencrantz.] Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both? What news?)
(2208%&%Ros. (L.) None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.)
(2210%&%Ham. (C.) Then is dooms-day near: but your news is not true. In the beaten way of friendship,30 what make you at Elsinore?)
(2214%&%Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you. Were you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come, come, deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.)
(2218%&%Ham. Any thing—but to the purpose. You were sent for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties have not craft enough to colour: I know the good king and queen have sent for you.)
(2222%&%Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights of our fellowship, [taking their hands,] by the consonancy of our youth,31 by the obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer32 could charge you withal, be even33 and direct with me, whether you were sent for, or no?)
(2237%&%Ham. (Returning C.) I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather.35 I have of late (but wherefore I know not) lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and, indeed, it goes so heavily with my disposition, that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a steril promontory; this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this 41majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason! how infinite in faculties! in form and moving how express36 and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world! the paragon37 of animals! And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not me,—nor woman neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.)
(2239%&%Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.)
(2241%&%Ham. Why did you laugh, then, when I said, Man delights not me?)
(2243%&%Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten entertainment38 the players shall receive from you: we coted them on the way;39 and hither are they coming, to offer you service.)
(2245%&%Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome, his majesty shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall end his part in peace;40 and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't.41—What players are they?)
(2247%&%Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the tragedians of the city.)
(2249%&%Ham. How chances it, they travel?42 their residence, both in reputation and profit, was better both ways. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city? Are they so followed?)
(2253%&%42Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is king of Denmark,43 and those that would make mouths at him44 while my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.45 There is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out.)
(2259%&%Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands. You are welcome: but my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.)
(2263%&%Ham. I am but mad north-north west: when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a hern-shaw.46)
(2269%&%Ham. (Crosses C.) Hark you, Guildenstern;—and Rosencrantz: that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling-clouts.)
(2271%&%Ros. (R.) Haply he's the second time come to them; for they say an old man is twice a child.)
(2273%&%Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players; mark it.—You say right, sir: o'Monday morning; 'twas then, indeed.)
(2279%&%Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in Rome,——)
(2289%&%Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastorical-comical, historical-pastoral, scene indivisible, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light.49 For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men.50)
(2307%&%Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I love passing well.)
(2313%&%Ham. Why, As by lot, God wot,51 and then, you know, It came to pass, As most like it was,—The first row of the pious Chanson52 will show you more; for look, my abridgment comes.53)
(2315%&%Enter Four or Five Players (L.H.)—Polonius crosses behind Hamlet to R.H.)
(2317%&%You are welcome, masters; welcome, all: O, old friend! 44Why, thy face is valanced54 since I saw thee last; Com'st thou to beard me55 in Denmark?—What, my young lady and mistress. By-'r-lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine.56 You are welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers,57 fly at anything we see: We'll have a speech straight: Come, give us a taste of your quality;58 come, a passionate speech.)
(2321%&%Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once,—but it was never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas caviare to the general:59 but it was an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning.60 One speech in it I chiefly loved; 'twas Æneas' tale to Dido; and thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of Priam's slaughter: If it live in your memory, begin at this line; let me see, let me see;—)
(2323%&%The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,—'tis not so: it begins with Pyrrhus:)
(2332%&%Pol. (R.) 'Fore Heaven, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion.)
(2374%&%Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.— Say on;—come to Hecuba.)
(2376%&%1st Play. But who, ah woe, had seen the mobled queen—)
(2395%&%Pol. Look, whether he has not turned his colour, and has tears in's eyes.—Prithee, no more.)
(2397%&%Ham. (C.) 'Tis well; I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.—Good, my lord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time: After your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.)
(2399%&%Pol. (R.) My lord, I will use them according to their desert.)
(2401%&%Ham. Much better: Use every man after his desert, and who shall 'scape whipping? Use them after your own honour and dignity: The less they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty. Take them in.)
(2411%&%Old friend [Crosses to C.] —My good friends [To Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.] I'll leave you till night: you are welcome to Elsinore—can you play the murder of Gonzago?)
(2417%&%Ham. We'll have it to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which I would insert in't—could you not?)
(2421%&%Ham. Very well.—Follow that lord; and look you mock him not.)
(2478%&%Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i'the throat,)
(2553%&%II.1 Polonius,] Doctor Johnson describes Polonius as "a man bred in courts, exercised in business, stored with observation, confident in his knowledge, proud of his eloquence, and declining into dotage. A man positive and confident, because he knows his mind was once strong, and knows not that it is become weak." The idea of dotage encroaching upon wisdom will solve all the phenomena of the character of Polonius.)
(2557%&%II.3 Ecstacy of love;] i.e., madness of love. In this sense the word is now obsolete.)
(2565%&%i.e., this must be made known to the king, for (being kept secret) the hiding Hamlet's love might occasion more mischief to us from him and the queen, than the uttering or revealing of it will occasion hate and resentment from Hamlet.)
(2567%&%It was the custom of Shakespeare's age, to conclude acts and scenes with a couplet, a custom which was continued for nearly a century afterwards.)
(2569%&%II.5 The understanding of himself,] i.e., the just estimate of himself.)
(2575%&%II.8 In the full bent,] To the full stretch and range—a term derived from archery.)
(2577%&%II.9 The trail of policy] The trail is the course of an animal pursued by the scent.)
(2579%&%II.10 Expostulate] To expostulate is to discuss, to put the pros and cons, to answer demands upon the question. Expose is an old term of similar import.)
(2583%&%II.12 Most beautified Ophelia,] Heywood, in his History of Edward VI., says "Katharine Parre, Queen Dowager to King Henry VIII., was a woman beautified with many excellent virtues." The same expression is frequently used by other old authors.)
(2585%&%II.13 In her excellent white bosom,] The ladies, in Shakespeare's time, wore pockets in the front of their stays.)
(2587%&%II.14 These, &c.] In our poet's time, the word these was usually added at the end of the superscription of letters.)
(2589%&%II.15 I am ill at these numbers;] No talent for these rhymes.)
(2593%&%II.17 Whilst this machine is to him,] Belongs to, obey his impulse; so long as he is "a sensible warm motion," the similar expression to "While my wits are my own.")
(2599%&%II.20 If I had played the desk, or table book;] This line may either mean if I had conveyed intelligence between them, or, known of their love, if I had locked up his secret in my own breast, as closely as it were confined in a desk or table book.)
(2601%&%II.21 Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb;] i.e., connived at it.)
(2607%&%II.24 Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;] She took the fruits of advice when she obeyed advice, the advice was then made fruitful.—Johnson.)
(2611%&%II.26 You are a fishmonger.] This was an expression better understood in Shakespeare's time than at present, and no doubt was relished by the audience of the Globe Theatre as applicable to the Papists, who in Queen Elizabeth's time were esteemed enemies to the Government. Hence the proverbial phrase of He's an honest man and eats no fish; to signify he's a friend to the Government and a Protestant.)
(2613%&%II.27 For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god, kissing carrion,——Have you a daughter?] i.e., Hamlet having just remarked that honesty is very rare in the world, adds, that since there is so little virtue, since corruption abounds everywhere, and maggots are bred by the sun, which is a god, even in a dead dog, Polonius ought to take care to prevent his daughter from walking in the sun, lest she should prove "a breeder of sinners;" for though conception (understanding) in general be a blessing, yet as Ophelia might chance to conceive (to be pregnant), it might be a calamity. Hamlet's abrupt question, "Have you a daughter?" is evidently intended to impress Polonius with the belief of the Prince's madness.—Malone.)
(2615%&%II.28 The satirical rogue] Hamlet alludes to Juvenal, who in his 10th Satire, describes the evils of long life.)
(2619%&%II.30 Beaten way of friendship,] Plain track, open and unceremonious course.)
(2621%&%II.31 Rights of our fellowship and constancy of our youth,] Habits of familiar intercourse and correspondent years.)
(2623%&%II.32 A better proposer] An advocate of more address in shaping his aims, who could make a stronger appeal.)
(2627%&%II.34 Nay, then, I have an eye of you.] i.e., I have a glimpse of your meaning. Hamlet's penetration having shown him that his two friends are set over him as spies.)
(2629%&%II.35 So shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather.] Be beforehand with your discovery, and the plume and gloss of your secret pledge be in no feather shed or tarnished.)
(2635%&%II.38 Lenten entertainment] i.e., sparing, like the entertainments given in Lent.)
(2637%&%II.39 We coted them on the way;] To cote, is to pass by, to pass the side of another. It appears to be a word of French origin, and was a common sporting term in Shakespeare's time.)
(2639%&%II.40 The humorous man shall end his part in peace;] The fretful or capricious man shall vent the whole of his spleen undisturbed.)
(2641%&%II.41 The lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't.] i.e., the lady shall mar the measure of the verse, rather than not express herself freely and fully.)
(2645%&%II.43 It is not very strange; for my uncle is king of Denmark;] This is a reflection on the mutability of fortune, and the variableness of man's mind.)
(2647%&%II.44 Make mouths at him] i.e., deride him by antic gestures and mockery.)
(2651%&%II.46 I know a hawk from a hern-shaw.] A hernshaw is a heron or hern. To know a hawk from a hernshaw is an ancient proverb, sometimes corrupted into handsaw. Spencer quotes the proverb, as meaning, wise enough to know the hawk from its game.)
(2653%&%II.47 Buz, buz!] Sir William Blackstone states that buz used to be an interjection at Oxford when any one began a story that was generally known before.)
(2655%&%II.48 Then came each actor on his ass.] This seems to be a line of a ballad.)
(2657%&%II.49 Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light.] An English translation of the tragedies of Seneca was published in 1581, and one comedy of Plautus, viz., the Menœchme, in 1595.)
(2659%&%II.50 For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men.] The probable meaning of this passage is,—For the observance of the rules of the Drama, while they take such liberties, as are allowable, they are the only men—writ is an old word for writing.)
(2661%&%II.51 As by lot, God wot,] There was an old ballad entitled the song of Jephthah, from which these lines are probably quotations. The story of Jephthah was also one of the favourite subjects of ancient tapestry.)
(2663%&%II.52 The first row of the pious Chanson] This expression does not appear to be very well understood. Steevens tells us that the pious chansons were a kind of Christmas carols, containing some scriptural history thrown into loose rhymes, and sung about the streets. The first row appears to mean the first division of one of these.)
(2665%&%II.53 My abridgment comes.] Hamlet alludes to the players, whose approach will shorten his talk.)
(2667%&%II.54 Thy face is valanced] i.e., fringed with a beard. The valance is the fringes or drapery hanging round the tester of a bed.)
(2669%&%II.55 Com'st thou to beard me] To beard anciently meant to set at defiance. Hamlet having just told the player that his face is valanced, is playing upon the word beard.)
(2671%&%II.56 By the altitude of a chopine.] A chioppine is a high shoe, or rather clog, worn by the Italians. Venice was more famous for them than any other place. They are described as having been made of wood covered with coloured leather, and sometimes even half a yard high, their altitude being proportioned to the rank of the lady, so that they could not walk without being supported.)
(2673%&%II.57 Like French falconers,] The French seem to have been the first and noblest falconers in the western part of Europe. The French king sent over his falconers to show that sport to King James the First. —See Weldon's Court of King James.)
(2677%&%II.59 Caviare to the general;] Caviare is the spawn of fish pickled, salted, and dried. It is imported from Russia, and was considered in the time of Shakespeare a new and fashionable luxury, not obtained or relished by the vulgar, and therefore used by him to signify anything above their comprehension—general is here used for the people.)
(2679%&%II.60 As much modesty as cunning.] As much propriety and decorum as skill.)
(2681%&%II.61 Falls with the whiff and wind of his fell sword] Our author employs the same image in almost the same phrase:)
(2695%&%II.65 His whole functions suiting with forms to his conceit?] i.e., his powers and faculties—the whole energies of his soul and body giving material forms to his passion, such as tone of voice, expression of face, requisite action, in accordance with the ideas that floated in his conceit or imagination.)
(2699%&%II.67 Like John a-dreams,] Or dreaming John, a name apparently coined to suit a dreaming, stupid person; he seems to have been a well-known character.)
(2701%&%II.68 Unpregnant of my cause,] i.e., not quickened with a new desire of vengeance; not teeming with revenge.)
(2705%&%II.70 Lack gall to make oppression bitter;] i.e., lack gall to make me feel the bitterness of oppression.)
(2711%&%II.73 I'll tent him to the quick:] i.e., probe him—search his wounds.)
(2723%&%Enter King and Queen, preceded by Polonius. Ophelia, Rosencrantz, and Giuldenstern, following (R.H.))
(2733%&%Guild. (R.) Nor do we find him forward1 to be sounded)
(2764%&%King. With all my heart; and it doth much content me)
(2846%&%Ham. To be, or not to be, that is the question:8)
(2912%&%And lose the name of action.22 [—Ophelia returns.—] Soft you now!23)
(2957%&%Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.25)
(2959%&%Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?)
(2961%&%Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd, than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness:26 this was some time a paradox, but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.)
(2965%&%Ham. You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock, but we shall relish of it:27 I loved you not.)
(2969%&%Ham. Get thee to a nunnery: Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest; but yet I could accuse me of such things, that it were better my mother had not borne me: I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my beck28 than I have thoughts to put them in,29 imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I do, crawling between earth and heaven? 54We are arrant knaves, all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your father?)
(2973%&%Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.)
(2977%&%Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry. Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a nunnery; farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; go; go.)
(2981%&%Ham. I have heard of your paintings30 too, well enough; Heaven hath given you one face, and you make yourselves another:31 you jig, you amble, and you lisp,32 and nickname Heaven's creatures, and make your wantonness your ignorance.33 Go to, I'll no more of't; it hath made me mad. [Hamlet crosses to R.H.] I say, we will have no more marriages: those that are married already, all but one,34 shall live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery, go.)
(3004%&%To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!)
(3061%&%Ham. (C.) Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it, as many of our players do, I had as lief42 the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hands thus;43 but use all gently: for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say) whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul, to hear a robustious perrywig-pated fellow44 tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings,45 who, for the most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise: I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant;46 it out-herods Herod:47 Pray you, avoid it.)
(3065%&%Ham. Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your tutor; suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, 57scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time its form and pressure.48 Now, this overdone, or come tardy off,49 though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of which one50 must, in your allowance,51 o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,52 that, neither having the accent of christians, nor the gait of christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed, that I have thought some of nature's journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.)
(3069%&%1st Play. (L.) I hope we have reformed that indifferently53 with us.)
(3071%&%Ham. O, reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them:54 for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators55 to laugh too; though, in the mean time, some necessary question56 of the play be then to be considered: that's villainous, and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.)
(3093%&%To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?)
(3154%&%March. Enter King and Queen, preceded by Polonius, Ophelia, Horatio, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, Lords, Ladies, and Attendants. King and Queen sit (L.H.); Ophelia (R.H.))
(3158%&%Ham. (C.) Excellent, i'faith; of the cameleon's dish: I eat the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.)
(3160%&%King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not mine.65)
(3162%&%Ham. No, nor mine, now.66 My lord,—you played once in the university, you say?67 [To Polonius, L.])
(3164%&%Pol. (L.C.) That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.)
(3168%&%Pol. I did enact Julius Cæsar:68 I was killed i'the Capitol; Brutus killed me.)
(3170%&%Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there.—Be the players ready?)
(3190%&%Ham. O, your only jig-maker.71 What should a man do but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.)
(3194%&%Ham. So long? Nay, then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a suit of sables.72 O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half a year: But, by'r-lady, he must build churches, then.73)
(3216%&%61Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?75)
(3224%&%P. King. (R.) Full thirty times hath Phœbus' cart76 gone round)
(3232%&%P. Queen. (L.) So many journeys may the sun and moon)
(3244%&%P. King. 'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;)
(3267%&%P. King. I do believe you think what now you speak;)
(3275%&%62P. Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!)
(3310%&%King. Have you heard the argument?80 Is there no offence in't?)
(3312%&%Ham. No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i'the world.)
(3316%&%Ham. The mouse-trap.81 Marry, how? Tropically.82 This play is the image of a murder83 done in Vienna: Gonzago is the Duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you shall see anon;—'tis a knavish piece of work: but what of that? your majesty, and we that have free souls, it touches us not: Let the galled jade wince,84 our withers85 are unwrung.)
(3324%&%Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see the puppets dallying.87 Begin, murderer; leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:—)
(3344%&%Ham. He poisons him i' the garden for his estate. His name's Gonzago: the story is extant, and written in very choice Italian: You shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago's wife.)
(3363%&%O, good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand pounds. Didst perceive?)
(3375%&%Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (L.H.) Hamlet seats himself in the chair (R.))
(3377%&%Guil. (L.C.) Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.)
(3391%&%Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more rich to signify this to the doctor; for, for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into more choler.)
(3393%&%Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start not so wildly from my affair.)
(3397%&%Guil. The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit, hath sent me to you.)
(3401%&%Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed. If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do your mother's commandment: if not, your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business.)
(3407%&%Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased! But, sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command: or rather as you say, my mother: therefore no more, but to the matter: My mother, you say,—)
(3409%&%65Ros. (Crosses to C.) Then thus she says: Your behaviour hath struck her into amazement and admiration.93)
(3411%&%Ham. O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration?—impart.)
(3413%&%Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you go to bed.)
(3415%&%Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any further trade with us?94)
(3423%&%Ros. (R.) Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you do, surely, bar the door of your own liberty, if you deny your griefs to your friend.96)
(3427%&%Ros. How can that be, when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in Denmark?97)
(3429%&%Ham. Ay, sir, but While the grass grows,—the proverb is something musty.98)
(3435%&%[Exeunt Horatio and Musicians R.H. Guildenstern, after speaking privately to Rosencrantz, crosses behind Hamlet to R.H.])
(3437%&%66Why do you go about to recover the wind of me,100 as if you would drive me into a toil?101)
(3439%&%Guil. (R.) O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.102)
(3441%&%Ham. (C.) I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?)
(3453%&%Ham. 'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with your fingers and thumb, give it breath with your mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music.103 Look you, these are the stops.)
(3455%&%Guil. But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony; I have not the skill.)
(3457%&%Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass: and there is much music, excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot you make it speak. 'Sdeath, do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me, you cannot play upon me.104)
(3463%&%Pol. (R.) My lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently.)
(3465%&%67Ham. (C.) Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?)
(3477%&%Ham. Then will I come to my mother by and by. They fool me to the top of my bent.105 I will come by and by.)
(3512%&%King. I like him not; nor stands it safe with us107)
(3565%&%Pol. He will come straight. Look, you lay home to him:112)
(3567%&%Tell him his pranks have been too broad113 to bear with,)
(3609%&%Queen. Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.)
(3611%&%Ham. Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;)
(3675%&%Queen. (Sits R.C.) What have I done, that thou dar'st wag thy tongue)
(3790%&%Save me [Starts from his chair], and hover o'er me with your wings,)
(3798%&%Ham. (L.) Do you not come your tardy son to chide,)
(3867%&%[Exit Ghost, L.H. Hamlet sinks into chair C. The Queen falls on her knees by his side.])
(3947%&%III.5 May here affront Ophelia:] To affront is to come face to face—to confront.)
(3953%&%III.8 To be, or not to be, that is the question:] Hamlet is deliberating whether he should continue to live, or put an end to his existence.)
(3955%&%III.9 Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,] A sea of troubles among the Greeks grew into a proverbial usage; so that the expression figuratively means, the troubles of human life, which flow in upon us, and encompass us round like a sea.)
(3957%&%III.10 This mortal coil,] Coil is here used in each of its senses, that of turmoil or bustle, and that which entwines or wraps round.)
(3964%&%That makes calamity of so long life;] The consideration that makes the evils of life so long submitted to, lived under.)
(3966%&%III.13 The whips and scorns of time,] Those sufferings of body and mind, those stripes and mortifications to which, in its course, the life of man is subjected.)
(3970%&%III.15 His quietus make] Quietus means the official discharge of an account: from the Latin. Particularly in the Exchequer accounts, where it is still current. Chiefly used by authors in metaphorical senses.)
(3972%&%III.16 A bare bodkin?] Bodkin was an ancient term for a small dagger. In the margin of Stowe's Chronicle it is said that Cæsar was slain with bodkins.)
(3974%&%III.17 Who would fardels bear,] Fardel is a burden. Fardellus, low Latin.)
(3978%&%III.19 No traveller returns,] The traveller whom Hamlet had seen, though he appeared in the same habit which he had worn in his life-time, was nothing but a shadow, "invulnerable as the air," and, consequently, incorporeal. The Ghost has given us no account of the region from whence he came, being, as he himself informed us, "forbid to tell the secrets of his prison-house."—Malone.)
(3980%&%III.20 Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;] A state of doubt and uncertainty, a conscious feeling or apprehension, a misgiving "How our audit stands.")
(3982%&%III.21 Of great pith and moment,] i.e., of great vigour and importance.)
(3989%&%From this sole consideration have their drifts diverted, and lose the character and name of enterprise.)
(3991%&%III.23 Soft you now!] A gentler pace! have done with lofty march!)
(3993%&%III.24 Nymph, in thy orisons] i.e., in thy prayers. Orison is from oraison—French.)
(3995%&%III.25 If you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.] i.e., if you really possess these qualities, chastity and beauty, and mean to support the character of both, your honesty should be so chary of your beauty, as not to suffer a thing so fragile to entertain discourse, or to be parleyed with.)
(3997%&%The lady interprets the words otherwise, giving them the turn best suited to her purpose.)
(3999%&%III.26 His likeness:] Shakespeare and his contemporaries frequently use the personal for the neutral pronoun.)
(4001%&%III.27 Inoculate our old stock, but we shall relish of it:] So change the original constitution and properties, as that no smack of them shall remain. "Inoculate our stock" are terms in gardening.)
(4003%&%III.28 With more offences at my beck] That is, always ready to come about me—at my beck and call.)
(4005%&%III.29 Than I have thoughts to put them in, &c.] "To put a thing into thought," Johnson says, is "to think on it.")
(4007%&%III.30 I have heard of your paintings,] These destructive aids of beauty seem, in the time of Shakespeare, to have been general objects of satire.)
(4009%&%III.31 Heaven hath given you one face, and you make yourselves another:] i.e., Heaven hath given you one face, and you disfigure his image by making yourself another.)
(4011%&%III.32 You jig, you amble, and you lisp,] This is an allusion to the manners of the age, which Shakespeare, in the spirit of his contemporaries, means here to satirise.)
(4013%&%III.33 Make your wantonness your ignorance.] You mistake by wanton affectation, and pretend to mistake by ignorance.)
(4017%&%III.35 To a nunnery, go. Exit Hamlet.] There is no doubt that Hamlet's attachment to Ophelia is ardent and sincere, but he treats her with apparent severity because he is aware that Ophelia has been purposely thrown in his way; that spies are about them; and that it is necessary for the preservation of his life, to assume a conduct which he thought would be attributed to madness only.)
(4019%&%III.36 The expectancy and rose of the fair state,] The first hope and fairest flower. "The gracious mark o' the land.")
(4023%&%III.38 The mould of form,] The cast, in which is shaped the only perfect form.)
(4035%&%III.44 Robustious perrywig-pated fellow] This is a ridicule on the quantity of false hair worn in Shakespeare's time, for wigs were not in common use till the reign of Charles the Second. Robustious means making an extravagant show of passion.)
(4037%&%III.45 The ears of the groundlings,] The meaner people appear to have occupied the pit of the theatre (which had neither floor nor benches in Shakespeare's time), as they now sit in the upper gallery.)
(4039%&%III.46 O'er-doing Termagant;] The Crusaders, and those who celebrated them, confounded Mahometans with Pagans, and supposed Mahomet, or Mahound, to be one of their deities, and Tervagant or Termagant, another. This imaginary personage was introduced into our old plays and moralities, and represented as of a most violent character, so that a ranting actor might always appear to advantage in it. The word is now used for a scolding woman.)
(4041%&%III.47 It out-herods Herod:] In all the old moralities and mysteries this personage was always represented as a tyrant of a very violent temper, using the most exaggerated language. Hence the expression.)
(4043%&%III.48 The very age and body of the time its form and pressure.] i.e., to delineate exactly the manners of the age, and the particular humours of the day—pressure signifying resemblance, as in a print.)
(4045%&%III.49 Come tardy off,] Without spirit or animation; heavily, sleepily done.)
(4047%&%III.50 The censure of which one] i.e., the censure of one of which.)
(4051%&%III.52 Not to speak it profanely,] i.e., irreverently, in allusion to Hamlet's supposition that God had not made such men, but that they were only the handy work of God's assistants.)
(4055%&%III.54 Speak no more them is set down for them:] Shakespeare alludes to a custom of his time, when the clown, or low comedian, as he would now be called, addressing the audience during the play, entered into a contest of raillery and sarcasm with such spectators as chose to engage with him.)
(4063%&%III.58 Pregnant hinges of the knee,] i.e., bowed or bent: ready to kneel where thrift, that is, thriving, or emolument may follow sycophancy.)
(4065%&%III.59 Since my dear soul] Dear is out of which arises the liveliest interest.)
(4067%&%III.60 Whose blood and judgment] Dr. Johnson says that according to the doctrine of the four humours, desire and confidence were seated in the blood, and judgment in the phlegm, and the due mixture of the humours made a perfect character.)
(4069%&%III.61 The very comment of thy soul] The most intense direction of every faculty.)
(4071%&%III.62 Occulted guilt do not itself unkennel] Stifled, secret guilt, do not develope itself.)
(4073%&%III.63 As Vulcan's stithy.] A stithy is the smith's shop, as stith is the anvil.)
(4075%&%III.64 In censure of his seeming.] In making our estimate of the appearance he shall put on.)
(4077%&%III.65 I have nothing with this answer; these words are not mine.] i.e., they grow not out of mine: have no relation to anything said by me.)
(4079%&%III.66 No, nor mine, now.] They are now anybody's. Dr. Johnson observes, "a man's words, says the proverb, are his own no longer than while he keeps them unspoken.")
(4081%&%III.67 You played once in the university, you say?] The practice of acting Latin plays in the universities of Oxford and Cambridge is very ancient, and continued to near the middle of the last century.)
(4083%&%III.68 I did enact Julius Cæsar:] A Latin play on the subject of Cæsar's death, was performed at Christ-church, Oxford, in 1582.)
(4085%&%III.69 They stay upon your patience.] Patience is here used for leisure.)
(4087%&%III.70 Lying down at Ophelia's feet.] To lie at the feet of a mistress during any dramatic representation, seems to have been a common act of gallantry.)
(4089%&%III.71 Jig-maker,] Writer of ludicrous interludes. A jig was not in Shakespeare's time only a dance, but a ludicrous dialogue in metre; many historical ballads were also called jigs.)
(4091%&%III.72 For I'll have a suit of sables.] Wherever his scene might be, the customs of his country were ever in Shakespeare's thoughts. A suit trimmed with sables was in our author's own time the richest dress worn by men in England. By the Statute of Apparel, 24 Henry VIII., c. 13, (article furres), it is ordained, that none under the degree of an Earl may use sables.)
(4093%&%III.73 He must build churches, then.] Such benefactors to society were sure to be recorded by means of the feast day on which the patron saints and founders of churches were commemorated in every parish. This custom has long since ceased.)
(4095%&%III.74 Miching mallecho;] To mich is a provincial word, signifying to lie hid, or to skulk, or act by stealth. It was probably once generally used. Mallecho is supposed to be corrupted from the Spanish Malechor, which means a poisoner.)
(4097%&%III.75 The posy of a ring?] Such poetry as you may find engraven on a ring.)
(4101%&%III.77 Tellus' orbèd ground,] i.e., the globe of the earth. Tellus is the personification of the earth, being described as the first being that sprung from Chaos.)
(4103%&%III.78 My operant powers their functions leave to do:] i.e., my active energies cease to perform their offices.)
(4105%&%III.79 What we do determine, oft we break.] Unsettle our most fixed resolves.)
(4117%&%III.83 The image of a murder,] i.e., the lively portraiture, the correct and faithful representation of a murder, &c.)
(4121%&%III.85 Our withers are unwrung.] Withers is the joining of the shoulder bones at the bottom of the neck and mane of a horse. Unwrung is not pinched.)
(4123%&%III.86 You are as good as a chorus,] The persons who are supposed to behold what passes in the acts of a tragedy, and sing their sentiments between the acts.)
(4125%&%The use to which Shakespeare converted the chorus, may be seen in King Henry V.)
(4127%&%III.87 I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see the puppets dallying.] This refers to the interpreter, who formerly sat on the stage at all puppet shows, and explained to the audience. The puppets dallying are here made to signify to the agitations of Ophelia's bosom.)

Columbine was emblematical of forsaken lovers.)
(5004%&%IV.27 There's rue for you; and here's some for me:—we may call it herb of grace o' Sundays:] Probably a quibble is meant here, as rue anciently signified the same as ruth, i.e., sorrow. In the common dictionaries of Shakespeare's time, it was called herb of grace. Ophelia wishes to remind the Queen of the sorrow and contrition she ought to feel for her unlawful marriage; and that she may wear her rue with peculiar propriety on Sundays, when she solicits pardon for the crime which she has so much occasion to rue and repent of.—Malone.)
(5006%&%IV.28 You may wear your rue with a difference.] i.e., to distinguish it from that worn by Ophelia, herself: because her tears flowed from the loss of a father—those of the Queen ought to flow for her guilt.)

(5072%&%1st Clo. (R.) Is she to be buried in christian burial that wilfully seeks her own salvation?)
(5074%&%2nd Clo. (L.) I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight:2 the crowner3 hath set on her, and finds it christian burial.)
(5076%&%1st Clo. How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence?)
(5080%&%1st Clo. It must be se offendendo;4 it cannot be else. For here lies the point: If I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and an act hath three branches; it is, to act, to do, and to perform:5 argal,6 she drowned herself wittingly.)
(5084%&%1st Clo. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here stands the man; good: If the man go to this water, and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he goes,8 mark 88you that; but if the water come to him and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.)
(5090%&%2nd Clo. Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out of christian burial.)
(5092%&%1st Clo. Why, there thou say'st:10 And the more pity that great folks should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves, more than their even christian.11 Come, my spade. There is no ancient gentlemen but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers: they hold up Adam's profession.)
(5096%&%1st Clo. He was the first that ever bore arms. I'll put another question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the purpose, confess thyself——13)
(5100%&%1st Clo. What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?)
(5102%&%2nd Clo. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.)
(5104%&%1st Clo. I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows does well; But how does it well? it does well to those that do ill: now, thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church: argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.)
(5106%&%2nd Clo. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?)
(5116%&%1st Clo. Cudgel thy brains no more about it,15 for your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when you are asked this question next, say, a grave-maker, the houses that he makes, last till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan, and fetch me a stoup of liquor.16)
(5132%&%Ham. (Behind the grave.) Has this fellow no feeling of his business, he sings at grave-making?)
(5134%&%Hor. (On Hamlet's R.) Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.)
(5136%&%Ham. 'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense.18)
(5149%&%Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing 90once: How the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! This might be the pate of a politician, which this ass now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent Heaven, might it not?)
(5155%&%Ham. Did these bones cost no more the breeding, but to play at loggats with them?19 mine ache to think on't.)
(5170%&%Ham. There's another: Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer? Where be his quiddits now, his quillets,21 his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce22 with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of his action of battery? I will speak to this fellow.—Whose grave's this, sirrah?)
(5180%&%Ham. (R. of grave.) I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't.)
(5182%&%1st Clo. You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is not yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.)
(5184%&%Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't, and say it is thine: 'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.)
(5186%&%1st. Clo. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again, from me to you.)
(5198%&%1st Clo. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.)
(5200%&%Ham. How absolute the knave is!23 we must speak by the card,24 or equivocation will undo us, [To Horatio, R.] How long hast thou been a grave-maker?)
(5202%&%1st Clo. Of all the days i'the year, I came to't that day that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.)
(5206%&%1st Clo. Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: It was the very day that young Hamlet was born,25 he that is mad, and sent into England.)
(5210%&%1st Clo. Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits there; or, if he do not, 'tis no great matter there.)
(5214%&%1st Clo. 'Twill not be seen in him there; there the men are as mad as he.)
(5226%&%1st Clo. Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty years.)
(5228%&%Ham. How long will a man lie i'the earth ere he rot?)
(5230%&%1st Clo. 'Faith, if he be not rotten before he die, he 92will last you some eight year or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.)
(5234%&%1st Clo. Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that he will keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore decayer of your ill-begotten dead body. Here's a skull now, hath lain in the earth three-and-twenty years.)
(5238%&%1st Clo. O, a mad fellow's it was: Whose do you think it was?)
(5242%&%1st Clo. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! he poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.)
(5249%&%Ham. Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath borne me on his back a thousand times. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft; and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is! Where be your gibes now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning? Quite chap-fallen? Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this favour26 she must come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing.)
(5259%&%[Gives the skull to Horatio, who returns it to the grave-digger.])
(5263%&%Ham. To what base uses may we return, Horatio! Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander, till it find it stopping a bung-hole?)
(5267%&%Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: As thus; Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth to dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make loam; And why of that loam, whereto he was converted, might they not stop a beer barrel?)
(5291%&%Enter Priests, &c., in procession; the corpse of Ophelia, Laertes and Mourners following; King, Queen, their Trains, &c.)
(5300%&%1st Priest. (R. of the grave.) Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd)
(5385%&%Laer. (L., leaping from the grave.) The devil take thy soul!)
(5404%&%Ham. (R.C.) Why, I will fight with him upon this theme)
(5506%&%Ham. Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to know him.)
(5508%&%Osr. (L.) Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart a thing to you from his majesty.)
(5510%&%Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit.50 Your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.)
(5514%&%Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.)
(5518%&%Ham. But yet, methinks it is very sultry and hot,51 for my complexion,—)
(5520%&%Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere,—I cannot tell how.—But, my lord, his majesty bade me signify to you, that he has laid a great wager on your head: Sir, this is the matter,—)
(5526%&%Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.52 Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and great showing:53 Indeed, to speak feelingly of him,54 he is the card or calendar of gentry,55 98for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see.56)
(5534%&%Osr. Sir, you are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is—)
(5536%&%Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to know himself.58)
(5546%&%Osr. The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary horses: against the which he has imponed,59 as I take it, six French rapiers and poignards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers,60 or so: Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit.61)
(5552%&%99Ham. The phrase would be more german62 to the matter, if we could carry cannon by our sides.)
(5554%&%Osr. The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; and it would come to immediate trial, if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.63)
(5558%&%Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.)
(5560%&%Ham. Sir, it is the breathing time of day with me; let the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose, I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.)
(5564%&%Ham. To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.)
(5572%&%Ham. (C.) I do not think so; since he went into France, I have been in continual practice; I shall win at the odds.65 But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here about my heart: but it is no matter.)
(5576%&%Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving,66 as would, perhaps, trouble a woman.)
(5578%&%Hor. If your mind dislike any thing, obey it:67 I will forestall their repair hither, and say, you are not fit.)
(5580%&%Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury: there is a special providence in the fall of a sparrow.)
(5587%&%King and Queen, on a dais, Laertes (R.), Lords (R.), Ladies (L.), Osric (R.) and Attendants, with Foils, &c., discovered (R.H.); Tables (R. and L.)—Flourish of Trumpets.)
